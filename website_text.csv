Sales Insight


table of content
Despite the adoption of inside sales, most selling teams tend to work best when they are working together. Sales is often about improvisation and collaboration with other functions and even large and distributed sales teams tend to do some activities in person - forecast meetings and reviews, sales training sessions, and cross-functional meetings. Remote working continues to grow across industries and several companies and their employees swear by their benefits. It is possible that even your Inside Sales team allows remote work, but as an exception and not a rule. However with the prevailing COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative that all sales leaders test the ability of their sales team to work remotely for extended periods - weeks, maybe months.
Here then are 3 tips to ready your sales team for remote working TIP 1 - Establish your Toolkit
A conversational intelligence tool like Salesken.ai would allow you to monitor the quality of all your reps’ conversations, glean helpful insights from the voice of your customers and let our AI, guide your reps on the frontline, with real-time cues and talking points. TIP 2 - Establish Processes
Once you have the right tools, it's important to set up processes that will enable your sales engine to keep cranking while your team works remotely.
Quick standups at the start and end of the working day will keep everyone clued in. It will also help you identify members of your team who may be struggling with the transition to remote sales. Try and use video conferencing where possible. This will ensure the connectedness and camaraderie of your team is preserved. TIP 3 - Continue to Improve
One of the limitations of remote working for sales leaders is the inability to improvise and adapt to changing marketing situations. Your “source of truth” is what your reps recall and record in the CRM and with everyone working away from each other - critical pieces of information will be lost.
Here then is how you can best replicate the high energy sales floor environment in a remote setup. (Disclaimer - this does include activities you can cover best with a conversational intelligence tool like Salesken.ai
In remote work, it will be harder for your reps to refer to their conversations for future actions or to discuss how they could have gone better. Using a conversation analytics tool like Salesken.ai will make this simpler - as you and your team would now have access to every call and its transcript with rich details. Your reps will not have to spend their time documenting every second of their conversations.
New competitors, market fluctuations, new feature requests, are all gathered over water cooler conversations or when you speak with your reps. With a tool like Salesken.ai, you will have the ability to record and analyze all calls and detect these trends early. It will also be convenient for your Solutions team and your Marketing team who will welcome these insights from the frontline As teams move to remote selling, it’s imperative to establish standardization. Most teams have a playbook or script they operate on. It’s important to enforce that your reps stick to playbooks and scripts in a remote setup. With Salesken.ai you will not only be able to ensure your reps are sticking to your playbook, but they will also get cues on how to handle every objection or how to best explain product features.

#1 Conversation Intelligence Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Onboarding new reps require a significant investment of time from sales managers and ensures they receive optimum quality training. A new sales rep must feel confident to be fully ramped up in their jobs. Salesken’s conversation intelligence provides a supporting onboarding experience with AI-enabled content cards and guides reps with accurate, relevant talking points at the moment instead of relying on sticky notes and static playbook.
Sales managers don’t have the time to join every sales call. Traditional call recording software does not have the ability to deliver real-time insights and recommendations and does not yield immediate results. Salesken’s conversation intelligence uses real-time call analytics with live talk time visibility to help them course-correct themselves, and track key moments to keep your reps focused on the customer instead of note-taking. The result is more immediate, and valuable, and boosts productivity.
Sales managers often lack the detailed insights required for specific, data-driven coaching since the data accrued often implement various, disparate systems. Salesken’s conversation intelligence helps sales managers scale their best coaches by providing coaching to all reps. It also eliminates surprises in critical calls and meetings by summarizing action items, notes, and bookmarks directly into your reps’ inboxes after the meeting. Backed by a one-to-many intelligent assistant, sales managers can spend more time coaching and providing impactful, actionable guidance to their teams.
Traditional sales tools only help sales managers identify the actions needed to make their top performers successful and their bottom performers unsuccessful. Salesken’s conversation intelligence helps managers to easily identify the performance category for each rep and offer clear insights into their top performers’ talk track, topics covered at each moment, time spent, questions asked, the ratio of speaking, and more to precisely tailor their coaching for average reps.
Reps commonly face difficult customer questions and objections and the only thing that sets one team apart from another is their ability to handle those questions well. A strong conversation intelligence software uses AI to analyze each conversation and categorize every prospect response and serve content cards that prompt reps with the correct talking points to offer real-time support and determine the best practices to support their team.

Put two and two together and say goodbye to fuzzy decisions out of closed-lost deals and tackle every bottleneck present in your pipeline to get ahead. Receive timely alerts for every deal in the pipeline before it’s too late with assistance from Salesken’s revenue intelligence software.

Top sales leaders use sales coaching software to bring their teams up to speed - it’s backed with science, reasoning, and data. Salesken’s sales coaching software combs every customer conversation to bring you data-backed insights to coach your sales reps into superstars.
It's time for a new way to coach sales reps. ‍ Salesken walks you through your sales team's performance in real-time, making it easier for you to decide where the coaching opportunities lie for critical sales behaviors and deal-closing skills—even as the landscape shifts, or reps turnover. There’s no one way to sell—not even when it comes to the most important thing: closing a sale. But there are also lots of little things that can make a big difference in that process: like being ready when the client asks questions, having trust in your product or service, and knowing how to find the right words. Those are skills you can learn, but it can be hard to remember them when you’re busy with other critical sales activities. That’s where Salesken comes in. We believe that everyone should be able to close more deals by doing less work—and we’re committed to helping you develop the skills you need so that you can do just that.
Training and onboarding your sales reps might seem like an easy task, but it’s more than just that. Salesken’s sales coaching software allows you to share, track, and analyze the progress.
Do not waste time searching for feedback and coaching moments for your sales rep - it’s daunting and not always right! Salesken’s AI-enabled coaching software provides data-driven insights and recommendations for each rep across 14 dimensions and identifies key coachable moments.
Track how your team performs and responds to sales coaching with real metrics and see which rep is performing well and who isn’t with Salesken. Find areas of improvement for the team with scorecards for each rep that gets automatically surfaced with Salesken.
Reduce ramp time from weeks to days through a library of well-curated sales conversations for virtual shadowing. Salesken captures and records real-time conversations and picks up winning behaviors, creates best practices, and shares them across the team.
We understand how daunting it might be to motivate your sales reps to bring their A-game every day and close a great number of deals. Create a leaderboard to track the progress of sales reps and gamify the learning experience to streamline and realign learning goals.
Follow these three simple steps to watch the magic unfold -
Salesken captures and records every sales conversation right from the first touchpoint to delivering the right coaching recommendations.
Salesken keeps track of every single coachable path you take as a sales manager and see how it’s being implemented across your teams and where to focus next
Salesken’s AI-powered software captures every interaction to separate winning behaviors and replicate them to create success across your team.
Unlike other sales coaching software, Salesken does so much more than just coach your team. Salesken is a champion in delivering the right recommendations, automating mundane tasks, and helping you close more deals.
Replicate winning plays with AI-enabled recommendations and improve sales productivity by 85%!
Understand your pipeline right from the first lead to the drop-off, and conversion.

#1 Sales Enablement Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Reduce onboarding time to ramp up the speed for new sales reps to structured training content and pre-recorded sales conversations with Salesken’s sales enablement software. Say goodbye to shadowing a sales manager on live calls. Review and analyze demo calls with tips and address coaching gaps to improve overall sales productivity and decrease ramp-up time.
Salesken provides data-backed insights and actionable strategies to help you identify training gaps from real sales conversations. Identify, analyze, and track coaching gaps to improve training and talking tracks of your sales reps and focus on sales enablement efforts to boost their performance and drive more revenue.
Even the best sales enablement programs can die quickly if no one is watching how sales use what’s been provided to them. It’s critical that sales management enforces the use of best practices, content, and tools in the sales organization. Salesken’s sales enablement software let you track if the content and assets provided are being used correctly or not.
Your program should provide salespeople with everything they need to engage and convert buyers. But what do you focus on next? Should you focus on detailed information about products and services? What about sharing best practices from top performers in the sales organization? How about the development of sales skills like delivering great presentations? Salesken equips you with the critical information needed to steer these questions and address objectives well to help you sell more and worry less.
Most sales training programs suffer from a fatal flaw and as a result, sales reps quickly forget what they’ve learned, the information they’ve received, the content, and tools they are aware of. With Salesken, make sales training a continuous effort by equipping your team with the right directory of sales conversations, personalized recommendations, and best practices throughout the year.
Tech-led efforts to improve sales enablement best practices such as efficient client communications also lead to major benefits for other departments within your enterprise. The best sales enablement tools give employees within these two separate divisions the solutions they need to collaborate effectively. No matter where in the world they may be, colleagues can share audience insights in real-time, send quality leads, and, importantly, provide the sales enablement collateral sellers need to close their deals.By allowing departments to work together, sales cycles can be shorter, organizations can produce the best sales content possible, and conversion rates and revenue can be higher.

The landscape of sales in 2023 is drastically shifted from traditional sales methods to varied methods of sales that directly impacts organizations.
Today, owing to a decline in profit margins, market trends, and cut throat competition, businesses are perceiving at sales and marketing models that are less cost-prohibitive and own higher closing rates as compared to traditional sales methods.
Naturally, organizations are now adopting inside sales or digital sales to reduce their costs while engaging their customers to build better relationships with interactive technology.
And thus, the demand for inside sales representative is on the rise, indicating a massive opportunity to learn.
So, what is inside sales and why must sales representatives learn the secret of the trade?
In this blog, you'll learn about -
Let's dive in.
The growth of technology, and improvements in communication has reduced the need for salespersons to meet the leads face-to-face and inside sales (or selling remotely) is slowly becoming the most dominant mode of selling.
Inside sales is the act of selling things in a remote environment, without actually meeting the customer in person or at their premises.
Here, communication is done primarily via phone, emails or social media and other digital channels.
Inside Sales is cost-effective, and it allows the teams to personalize the buying journey of the customers at scale.
Today, an increasing number of organizations are adapting inside sales strategy to ensure that they are accessing the maximum potential of their inside sales teams.
The upsurge around the activities of inside sales is a direct result of the converging influence of competition, schedules, budgets, advancements in social selling, and other sales and marketing automation tools.
These efficiencies around inside sales help sales people to reach out to customers in a cost-effective way.
An inside sales representative is a type of salesperson that works remotely or within an office to assist potential clients find what they are actively looking for.
Unlike other sales reps, inside sales representatives spend most of their day on the telephone, or writing emails, or other digital channels to not only assist customers but also deploy great sales strategies to close deals.
When a sales rep is hired, the expectations around their skillset varies from generating leads, creating sales pitches, hitting sales quotas, and generating revenue.
Acquiring, learning, and mastering sales skills can help you become better at your workplace and close more deals. Here are 12 most important sales skills to master -
Sales representatives must possess strong communication skills to build better customer relationship, and this doesn't necessarily limit to just talking abilities.
Possessing active listening skills means hearing out your customers and finding out what's best for them. Regardless of in-person selling or cold calling prospects, it is absolutely vital to let your customers talk.
Most times, your buyers willingly share their pain points, if you let them.
For an inside sales representative, having absolute product knowledge is a very important skill to have.
There's nothing worse than forgetting your core product features when on a demo with a potential customer. Or, how about when you field a product question you should know the answer to and miss an opportunity to highlight a star feature to a specific use-case?
Unimaginable, right?
Although some of these situations are inevitable in daily sales conversations and for new joiners, these type of mistakes can be solved in most cases by just understanding your product in various ways.
Thus, before finishing your sales training, it's vital you have detailed product knowledge of the features, advantages, benefits, use-cases, examples, and more.
Else, you will have immense difficulty selling your sales pitch to individual use-cases and helping prospects with the right features for their needs.
Not just that, this sales skill of having in-depth product knowledge also comes with an added benefit of establishing yourself as a product and domain expert, too.
Empathy enables your sales representatives to tune into verbal and non-verbal cues, and have a deep understanding of the client's emotions and feelings.
Having empathy is an important sales skill that helps salespeople to fully comprehend their customers' pain points, worries, and fears. As a result, salespeople can create enhanced emotional connections and build long-term relationships with their customers.
Prospects do not want to purchase from someone who doesn't consider their feelings and opinions. A great salesperson does not only sympathize when their customer shares their fears, but also deeply understands them beyond their pain points.
Contrary to common misconception, empathy is not a fixed skillset, it can be learned.
Develop and train your sales team with this skill by outlining the importance of empathy, how to develop this skill, and how it impacts your sales representatives' performance.
At the end of the day, the effectiveness of a sales rep is calculated by your sales productivity, the amount of revenue you generate, and the number of hours you worked.
If time management is a difficult area for you and sways your focus away, leverage an intuitive CRM, or a sales intelligent platform like Salesken to automate routine tasks. This helps you focus on actually selling and not spending hours together on admin tasks.
Do not forget that your prospects' time is equally important, too.
Stay respectful of the time your potential customer is giving you and personalize your conversation in a way to strike a balance between showing genuine interest by not wasting their time.
It is an ubiquitous fact that a sales representative spends most of their time during the day communicating.
Right from sending emails to holding meetings, making phone calls, and even using live chats - a sales representative leverages several channels to communicate their needs.
Possessing great communication skills is crucial for being a great salesperson. Having an effective and reliable tool to collaborate with your team and contact your prospects is a must.
Customers don't just listen to the content you say, but also observe your tone, listening skills, speed of talking, and the intimate knowledge you possess about the product.
In the world of sales and marketing, communication is the cardinal.
To polish your communication skills with your customers, ensure you are -
It is a common myth that only great salespeople are born with great storytelling.
As an inside sales representative, you may come across several cold calling pitches and email templates to help you boost your closing rate.
By continually educating yourself and learning the best sales techniques from your peers, you can level and upskill yourself.
Buyers do not really want to hear about your service and good sales people are already aware of this. Learning and mastering the art of weaving a story into your sales pitch that has an arc and ends with an 'aha' moment for the customer is really what sells the product.
The ultimate goal of relationship building is to simply build trust with your customer.
Although there's been a lot of chatter about relationship selling over the years, the ability to build relationships with your prospects will always remain as the core sales skills to master.
Simply put, relationship building is your ability to effectively engage with your sales team, and work to establish a level of connection that can last beyond just quick transactions and pitches.
More importantly, these customer relationships, when built genuinely on a foundation of providing high-value upfront without the expectation of an immediate transaction - can lead to exciting opportunities such as referrals, higher customer satisfaction, and excellent customer service.
A CRM, or a customer relationship management tool can easily become one of the most powerful tool for high-performing organizations and sales leaders, if you allow it to be.
A CRM has a myriad of capabilities to assist you with everyday activities and help you close more sales. Within the context of the functionality of your sales process, are you getting the maximum out of your current CRM?
If the answer is no, it's time to revisit your process.
If a CRM can deliver automated email sequences to new leads when they enter your sales funnel, freeing up hours of routine tasks for you - this change alone can save you hours of your time in a week.
Learning how to correctly use the features of your CRM to expedite your sales process and sales activities will help you greatly improve the efficiency.
Choose a CRM that has the following features -
An inside sales representative job is more than just picking up the phone to call a potential customer, or shooting emails - they also need to thoroughly understand and find out crucial details about their leads and their needs to increase the chances to closing more sales.
A good inside sales representative undertake research.
By analyzing and understanding your product in-depth, you can effectively explain every feature successfully.
With research, it is also vital to understand that inside sales representatives find out about who and why your potential customers would be interested in your pitch.
As exciting as it might be to just pick up your phone and dial that number, it is equally important to do your due diligence.
Ensure you gather enough information about your leads, how your product will be useful for them, and tailor the conversation accordingly.
Research the market, potential customers, use-cases of your product, and how you can reward your customers.
In this day, social selling is of great significance.
As important as it is, many companies are missing the mark with social media skills.
To make a great ISR, it is crucial you have a good grasp of social media. Most information about your lead is available publicly, thus, learning how to acquire and use this information will help you in getting their attention well.
However, you should not forget that your leads are researching you, too and it's highly likely that they know a lot about you, too.
Some of the best salespeople have great social skills and leverage it to organize dinners, hold effective meetings, carry out meaningful conversations, and hit their sales goals.
Say you have done all the job related to capturing an interest in your product from a promising lead, however, simply obtaining qualified and enthusiastic leads is not enough.
As an inside sales representative, it is important to not come across as extremely pushy, but you need to learn the art of contacting your prospects regularly in a way to improve chances of conversion.
This is why highly successful sales reps plan their follow-up calls to close more sales over time.
Follow-up with your prospects through automated emails and calls to keep them in the loop and help them stay warm. Depending on the way they receive the follow-up, decide on a strategy to further personalize your efforts.
A good way for an inside sales representative to stay on track with following up is to set up reminders for emails and daily calls to remain on schedule and help you hit your sales goals effectively.
One of the biggest concerns most organizations have when setting up their sales team is whether to focus on inside sales vs outside sales.
With the onset of the pandemic, most salespeople are working remotely. As we have progressed forward to a world that feels more normal, which model do companies default to?
To make things simpler, inside sales refers to sales made within an office, or a remote set-up via phone, email, social media, and other digital channels.
Inside sales, also called as remote sales, is not done face-to-face.
Whereas, outside sales on the other hand, involves sales reps traveling outside their office to the prospect's location to sell a service face-to-face.
Here's a quick breakdown to help you visualize the structure of an inside sales model vs outside sales model -
Inside sales, is undoubtedly, challenging.
In day-to-day sales activities, you may face several obstacles that make it difficult to help you meet your sales quotas.
Here are some of the challenges that you may face in your inside sales career -
In the modern day, a business of any niche may have several competitors.
With an increasing number of competitors arising, there's also a massive increase in competition.
Inside sales representatives find it extremely challenging to find new prospects and retain them, especially with this shift in the working environment.
Tip - Research your competitors using new tools and understand their USPs to analyze your competitive advantage.
Sales reps receive a high number of leads everyday.
However, not every lead will convert and sometimes, they may not even match your ideal profile.
Prospecting and qualifying the right leads is imperative and this can be a primary obstacle towards closing deals.
Tip - Work in tandem with the sales and marketing teams to getting high-quality leads. Jot down your ideal customer profile correctly to target the right lead and pass it on to the sales team.
With having to do a number of tasks everyday, sales reps usually complain they do not have enough time to do all their tasks.
While nurturing leads, making cold calls, following-up, scheduling meetings, and more, inside sales representatives lose a chunk of their time throughout the day.
Tip - Invest in a good quality CRM to reduce administrative tasks as much as possible and help your inside sales representatives to focus on other essential tasks to help them close more deals.
Although inside sales may seem like an ocean with a myriad of tips, techniques, and core skills to possess, the learning field is endless.
Inside sales representatives are powerful agents who leverage their time on acquiring leads, conducting research, and following supreme customer service.
Honing these 11 important inside sales representative skills will help you move seamlessly in any organization and achieve maximum success as an ISR.
If you are looking for an intuitive sales tool to help you become a successful inside sales representative by automating mundane tasks, coaching peers, tracking leads, and more, book a demo with us now!

A good programmer may not be good at selling, and a person great at sales may not be good at marketing.
This implies that every job requires a specific set of skills to get the job done well.
And sales isn’t an exception.
Selling isn’t an easy feat, and the best sales reps understand this, and are constantly updating and upskilling themselves to stay ahead of the game.
Today’s consumers are more aware than ever before and have multiple options, and sellers will need to be more empathetic, understand the true needs of the consumers and customize the pitch to improve engagement.
Sales reps to be successful, need to be able to build genuine rapport with the consumers and be their friend and advisor without coming across as too salesy.
So, how can a sales rep be more successful? And what qualities and attributes can help them stand out from the rest?
Read on to know more!
In essence, selling skills are the fundamental strategies and processes salespeople must master to incorporate their efforts, that result in a sale.
Salespeople are typically taught through coaching and peer learning, and experience, and are leveraged to a wide variety of prospects on a personal, thoughtful level.
Here are 11 essential qualities that must be followed by sales reps to become a good salesperson in 2023 -
To achieve better sales results, ask questions about your buyer's goals and pain points.
If you're wondering how to become a good salesperson, you need to pay attention to your prospects and customers and be fully present any time you have a conversation with them.
One of the most effective selling tactics is to listen to the customer carefully. This way, you can understand their pain points, challenges, fears, and expectations to connect with them on a personal level and show them that you genuinely want to help them out.
When prospects are relaxed, they typically discuss their actual issues at hand and be open to providing you with all the information. Ask the right questions to move further and understand your prospect better.
A handful of sales reps assume that the fastest way to make a name for yourself in the company is by blowing away your competition.
This approach is not only isolating, but you will also miss out on a lot of bonding and learning. Modern salespeople, regardless of their experience level, must practice and embrace team selling.
Bring in experts such as product managers, senior sales reps, or anyone relevant to the conversation to close more deals. You'll also learn valuable skills along the way, and regularly meet your quota at the end of each quarter.
It's a win-win!
The most important quality to imbibe is to build long-lasting relationships with customers.
As a good sales rep, your goal must be to help the customer and get the results they want. Remember that customers are less interested in your product but more inclined towards the results your product can help them achieve.
Your product may only help them solve a part of their problem; but you can help them solve other parts, too.
Sales reps need to understand the product’s USP, benefits, features, competitor’s products’ weaknesses and effectively communicate to the lead. It is essential for the reps to know all the sales collaterals inside-out to ensure that they don’t undersell or oversell the product benefits, and ensure long term customer retention.
Organizations typically have sales enablement content and collateral to ensure consistent messaging and positioning of the product at every stage of the customer journey and touch point.
But, a good sales rep must be able to tweak and add in a more personalized touch to the communication to ensure maximum success.
In sales, dealing with objections and roadblocks is inevitable, and also, challenging for most sales reps.
Objection handling is an art and the process entails following specific actions and skills that involve a bit of learning. Some soft skills to learn to manage objections easily are -
In general, objection handling requires a certain level of deftness. It requires a level of product, industry knowledge, and prospect background to handle.
This insinuates that knowing how to overcome objections respectfully and with compassion, even in unexpected situations, is a must.
This sales quality is one of the most important and leading qualities of inbound sales.
Marketing teams spend most of their time pushing out leads in the sales funnel, however, not all the leads they send are relevant to your product.
This is the power of inbound marketing.
Create and curate high-quality and highly relevant content for prospects to genuinely help them with the issues they are facing, and let them come to you. This not only brings in high-quality leads to the funnel but also improves your chances of closing a sale.
Technology is a crucial part of the sales process.
Modern-day customers are highly evolved and purchasing trends have drastically changed over the years. Applying the sales tactics of 2011 with the hopes of increasing sales volume in 2023 will most definitely not work.
Understanding and implementing the latest sales technologies such as sales automation, sales enablement, and optimization is the key to not just improving as a sales rep but also running your business more effectively.
Automation tools make sales reps live much easier, giving them the leeway to actually focus on making a sale, as opposed to spending half their time doing administrative tasks.
Tech-savvy customers know who exactly to purchase from without even going through an endless list of options if they feel their needs are not catered to.
Ensure you leverage the right technology to make the sales process seamless.
The most successful sales reps have clear goals and are constantly updating and upskilling themselves to ensure career progression.
They are aware of the industry trends (both theirs and their buyer’s), know their competitors inside out, are aware of the buyer’s needs and concerns, and personalize the pitch to improve engagements.
Also, successful sales reps network to build relationships within the seller’s community and are open to learning from both practitioners and other sources.
Their willingness to learn, clear career goals and perseverance, and patience, and sales reps put them on the path to success.
The saying, "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer", could not be more true in this context.
Regardless of how evolved your product may be, learning about your competitors in the market is absolutely necessary to succeed.
To learn about your competitors, you need to do a SWOT analysis of your competitors. Read through review aggregators like G2, TrustRadius, Software Reviews and other online communities, and know how your competitors are viewed by the market.
“Your competitor is charging 30% lower as compared to you” - this is one of the most common objections you’ll face when talking to the leads, and you need to be in a position to clearly articulate the benefits of your product and explain how you deliver better ROIs than your competitors.
This can only come from thorough research and knowing your competitors inside-out.
The sales world is practically different than any other profession.
As a successful sales rep, you must constantly be on the lookout to learn new skills, whilst chasing monthly and quarterly quotas and goals - this can, indeed, be quite stressful.
To make this easier, talk to people from your network to understand how they upskill themselves, and how their positions function and be wary of current trends to get a general sense of the skills you should be focusing on to be successful.
Be consistently active on social media channels such as LinkedIn and Twitter to connect with peers and leaders from your industry. This way, you're always up to date and can move progressively further in your career.
Critical thinking is a necessity in most occupations, and sales are no different.
Critical thinking entails decision-making, problem-solving, and a myriad of ranges of thinking possibilities to resolve issues, close deals, and push forward prospects in the sales cycle.
With critical thinking, sales reps can solve any customer challenges with ease.
To promote critical thinking when selling, follow these quick tips -
Sales is a complicated business.
And competent sales persons can improve the sales processes of any sales team by bringing in their own perspectives and constantly innovating and improving outcomes.
To become a good sales rep in 2023, you need to be driven, committed, and highly passionate. To put it in simple words, to be a successful sales rep, you need to work smarter.
Although we're slowly inching back towards adjusting to the new normal, do not allow it to obstruct your sales goals and hamper your success. Sales success, truly, comes down to being tuned into the market, being an expert in your niche, constantly learning, and asking the right questions.
Although we discuss a lot about B2B and B2C, at the end of it, you're selling to people - people who are experiencing roadblocks and people who cannot solve them.
If you're looking to have access to a sales intelligent tool to help you master the above-listed skills and become a good sales rep, book a demo with our experts to learn how!

It's 2023, and it's a digital-first world. Today's children learn to code before they learn cursive. To add to this, we've come across a myriad of ed-tech companies that indeed, make this dream come true.
We call this expertise digital skills but, for today's children, it's simply skills needed to be learned.
But what exactly are digital skills? And why do sales teams need it to succeed in their career?
To add to this, it's not just today's kids that are obsessed with technical knowledge.
For several sales professionals and sales managers, digital technologies aid them with a new channel to connect with and influence prospective customers, thus moving them from leads to customers.
In the modern age, speed is everything. This change is happening in response to the buying process that has evolved drastically; buyers have already changed their habits. As sales professionals, you need to catch up and be equipped with the right digital skills to build a lasting relationship with your customers and be ahead of the curve.
But, with the right training and guidance, sales teams, irrespective of their age, can acquire the key digital skills they need to become successful salespeople in 2023.
We have handpicked some essential skills that will help all the sales reps stay ahead in this digital world.
Sales is a highly competitive industry.
To thrive as a successful salesperson in this age, keeping up ahead of the market trends, new technologies, and relevant factors is what distinguishes between an average sales rep to a highly successful one.
Salespeople must know the art of researching online, and finding relevant information from online sources. Information about competitors can be found from review aggregators like G2, TrustRadius and other sources, and networking can help the reps understand their target customers and their industries better.
Possessing the knowledge to find the data online accurately, you can create ads and nurture your ideal customers with the right messaging and information,
This data can further be utilized to pinpoint personalized sales strategies that can help nurture and engage them in the sales cycle.
Digital literacy encompasses the digital sales skills needed to work, learn, and navigate day-to-day life in our sales world.
This means having the ability to use devices, software, apps, and more with confidence to communicate and collaborate better via digital mediums, handling data in a safe and appropriate way, and keeping abreast of new technologies.
With several social platforms out there in the market, it's absolutely vital to know which medium works the best for you with the audience you want to target and learn how to get your audience to notice you.
It is important to understand that there is no point in spending time curating catchy, and beautiful images on Instagram and Pinterest, when the audience you want to target are active on LinkedIn.
With a seemingly infinite number of social platforms out there, knowing which one to use for maximum success can be tricky.
Conduct appropriate market research and know every major platform to start posting regularly with relevant advertisements, promoting webinars and podcasts, and even maintaining an active profile will go a long way.
One of the most important sales skills to learn in this modern-day sales world is to analyze online customer behavior and data.
This sales skill can pose a distinct advantage as it endows them with the ability to be proactive and take a consumer-centric approach to sell their product or service with ease.
Possessing analytical knowledge can help you to unravel and evaluate your customers' habits, willingness to purchase your product or service, opportunities to push a sale, and more.
As a result, sales professionals will definitely be far more successful at meeting their sales goals and quotas regularly than alienating their customers.
Agility is quite the buzzword in today's digital age of selling.
However, agility is crucial in an ever-evolving digital sales environment. New developments in technology often turn today's sales environment quite obsolete. An agile sales rep will dive into new learning programs, get to know them inside out, and implement them to ensure success.
Additionally, agility allows sales reps to look at alternate solutions when the chosen strategy doesn't seem to be working.
Being agile and thinking on one's toes always allows sales teams to come up with various other plans that will clinch the sale.
Although curating and sharing content is essential, creating highly relevant content is vital.
This is a clear indication of the importance of creating unique, but highly relevant content that will capture the interest of prospective customers.
For instance, by publishing a fresh blog on LinkedIn or your company's blog, a salesperson's ability to showcase the depth of their knowledge and share key insights will build authority and engage prospects on a personal level is a fast-track route to bringing in more sales.
Time management is one of the important sales skills that every sales rep should possess.
Considering the number of sales activities they need to tick off every day, including interacting with multiple potential customers and clients, responding to emails, demonstrating the sales pitch, and more, making wise use of their time can improve things - both cost and productivity-wise.
Leveraging an automation software such as a CRM can greatly benefit your sales reps to handle their tasks more effectively and also, meet their goals effectively.
Although problem-solving entails soft sales skills, learning how to solve issues in the digital world, virtually, is an important skill.
Social sellers that provide profound, targeted insights and practical solutions to an issue will create a positive attitude and brand image online, thus, helping you to turn prospects into fully paid customers.
Tools such as Buzz Sumo, Feedly, and Social Mention enable sales reps to keep track of their prospects' movements on the internet with relevant keywords. Sales reps can also track conversations happening around your product or service, industry, and competitors.
Regular monitoring will help to identify pain points, issues, and recommendations that allow you to respond with valuable insights that lead to positive solutions.
Sales professionals that place themselves in their customer's shoes to ask the right questions and understand them deeply to analyze their pain points, expectations, and needs will win your trust and respect.
After all, loyal buyers could be valuable up to ten times more than new ones.
Listening skills are essential for salespeople, no doubt about it.
Conversations with prospects and current customers can be seamless when sales reps make conscious efforts to actually listen and absorb the information given to them.
Communication skills are fundamental in building trust and creating a positive rapport with customers. It's essential that salespeople are confident and knowledgeable when approaching and advising customers, but the value of truly listening can easily be overlooked.
The best way to ensure total coherence is to ask questions to understand their relevant pain points and summarize what you have been told.
A significant part of active listening is to treat others with compassion and respect you'd like to receive during a conversation, so they feel their requirements are well understood to meet mutual expectations.
In this day and age where social media and having an online presence is vital, creating a personal brand is vital to long-term career growth.
Branding is the only benefit that your competitors can never replace. Branding is your personality. It's true to itself and no one else can replace it. Copied, yes, but never replaced.
When managed correctly, branding is enough for your customers to keep coming back and make repeated purchases. Effective branding makes you more visible, memorable, and easily identifiable.
It attracts attention and accelerates the revenue engine.
Leverage sales technology that helps you stay on top of everyone's minds with impeccable branding and design, your own true unique value.
To continue the conversation and help your prospects and customers to trickle down further in the sales funnel, engagement is a key pillar to leverage to your existing tech stack.
This includes tools and technologies that drive proactive conversations such as social selling, social public speaking, and one-to-one engagement such as email, phone calls, and in-person and virtual meetings.
Having a myriad of engagement options readily available to your sales teams allows them to move forward from channel to channel to connect and interact better with sales prospects.
Regardless of the size of your company, having a vision and strategy is a must for all businesses.
Vision and strategy, when decided correctly, allow businesses to predict, work through, and meet their goals with less complexity, as opposed to businesses that have zero to no vision.
Vision is the most difficult pillar to establish since everyone in the company, right from the top to the bottom, must believe in it.
Digital sales transformation will fail indefinitely unless this foundation is established for everyone to prioritize. A non-existent digital strategy affects more than just the IT department.
It impacts everyone across the board and departments, and because the organization must continuously grow and evolve, it is absolutely critical that all departments, especially the sales teams, are equipped with the right sales tools to plan, predict, and work without any hassle.
Most sales leaders discuss how important digital adoption is to every company, but most of them forget the most critical part - their people!
People may not be the most important digital transformation pillar but, the company will struggle if it does not hire the right people or focus on its staff.
Employees must come first for leaders, and this goes without saying.
This relates to both employee experience and customer experience to nurture, value, and build people's relationships. Businesses that invest in their employees and their well-being, commit to their growth, and value them establish a sense of commitment that makes changes inside the organization a breeze.
Companies ought to remember who they are, with sales technologies entering their workspace, such as AI, VR, machine learning, and more.
Leveraging advanced sales technologies is to implement them in such a way that these technologies will help design memorable experiences that relate to their employees, customers, and others on a deeper level while maintaining human-to-human connections.
To move and become digital first, employees need to be on the same page.
With the recent pandemic forcing businesses to shift from in-person to online, the trends in cyber attacks have been alarming. Here are a few statistics -
Although it's quite a common phrase over the last decade that "every company is a technology company" and, if you're not one, the urge to become a tech-forward company is unparalleled.
To secure technology and practice safe transactions, you want to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack.
To be a highly secure company, be compliant with the most advanced security and privacy certification such as ISO, GDPR, SOC 2, and more, to avoid regular phishing attacks and save not just millions of dollars, but also critical data safe from attackers.
While these skills listed above will help you kickstart your sales skills to be a successful salesperson, to grow in your current role and efficiently advance, it is vital to be consistent.
It's important to learn and be adept with the latest sales job skills to engage, nurture, and delight new types of buyers and upsell your services to them.
Use the skills listed above to craft a unique selling technique that not just helps you stand out in your team, but also drive the sales engine.

Growth is one of the key agenda of all business leaders, and regardless of the size of the company, it's safe to assume that your business strategy works around growing your revenue.
There are a myriad of ways to grow your business and it may follow several directions too, but before you do, building a growth strategy is vital, one that will not just facilitate success but also helps you scale your operations and keep your employees productive.
At the center of this strategy should be technology, as you guessed it right.
In the modern business world, digital transformation is one of the driving forces behind long-term success and growth.
Sales technology is evolving just as fast as mar-tech is, and for the right reasons.
Sales technology has the ability to revamp your sales process by supporting your sales teams in generating more leads, fueling more insightful sales conversion tactics, and getting prospects to convert.
Salespeople can make use of sales technology to build a killer sales pipeline, enhance responsiveness, establish long-term relationships with customers and prospects, and ultimately, accelerate their sales by nurturing and converting leads.
But, before we dive in, what exactly is sales technology and why should a sales organization leverage it?
In this blog, we'll discuss -
Let's begin.
Today, although sales technology might be confused with software sales, especially that of SaaS products, there's more to it than just that.
Sales automation, sales enablement, and sales technology have evolved tremendously over the last few years. But, what is sales technology, and how is it different from sales automation and sales enablement?
Sales technology is defined as a set of tools that help improve and enhance sales productivity by enabling salespeople to leverage their time and customer intelligence effectively and efficiently.
Sales automation, on the other hand, is a subgroup of sales technology, which helps most salespeople automate their mundane tasks for higher productivity and optimal use of the sales rep's time.
Customer relationship management software is a leading example of sales automation.
On the contrary, sales enablement is also a subdivision of sales techniques that is used far and wide by sales and marketing teams across all organizations. Sales enablement is typically used to produce better and more relevant content to help prospects and customers throughout their journey seamlessly.
Sales enablement is often described as the process and tools that enable the sales and marketing team to produce the right kind of content at the right time to engage and nurture potential customers accordingly.
Sales technology has been growing steadily over the last few years - the number of tools, categories, and users.
AI, automation, machine learning, NLP, and more can revolutionize sales tasks that often go unnoticed by salespeople such as finding and sorting out leads, chatting with potential customers via chatbots, and closing sales deals.
Modern technology for sales and marketing are rapidly evolving, and this fact is ubiquitous.
We now have deeper, better insights into customer data, which can be used to provide personalized services catered to our customers' respective stages in the sales process.
Sales and technology complement one another flawlessly. With technology, sales leaders can improve overall productivity to a great extent, provide value to the business, manage raw data seamlessly, and find leads in this competitive environment.
Without a doubt, a great sales team can bring in tons of revenue to the business. However, to facilitate this, salespeople need to manage their time effectively to focus on making a sale, and not on routine tasks.
With sales technology, this is possible.
Investing and upgrading your business with sales technology, is really, investing in yourself.
It pays off in the long-term and can improve the overall health of your business, aka, revenue engine.
Modern technology has equipped us with new, novice ways to find quality leads that match your ideal customer profile.
With sales technology, here are some ways sales leaders can hunt leads that weren't available a decade ago -
More importantly, these sales tools leverage advanced technologies to aid sales professionals with the best route, personalize their method, and perform their best.
We can all agree that personalization and strategic sales processes can have a profound effect on the company's profits and customer lifetime value.
Switching to sales technology does not mean that the job of a salesperson is moot, or could extinguish. The role of a salesperson is equally, if not more, important to an organization.
Traditional sales have transformed into data-based interactions that leverage technology, to further support salespeople to perform their best and make their lives easier.
Having said that, as an organization, what kind of technology should you leverage to increase sales?
Modern sales teams leverage technology to drive higher revenue. From automating admin tasks, gathering customer insights to providing personalized, sales tech plays a major role in providing teams with an edge.
Here are 8 technologies that you can leverage to ensure your teams ace their goals -
A CRM is typically the first buy for any sales team.
It acts as a database of all your leads - right from the time they enter the funnel, till they are handed over to the customer success or support teams.
They provide insights on where the leads get stuck, and help you optimize those stages and improve outcomes.
The CRMs, when integrated with marketing automation software's and/or customer support software, can provide sales teams with insights on the customer as they go through all touchpoints. Teams can now identify which marketing campaigns generate maximum leads, and tailor the pitch and messaging accordingly to ensure maximum success.
Lead enrichment involves activities that sales teams do to get all relevant details of the lead - contact details, roles, and other relevant details that can help teams qualify and nurture only relevant leads.
Lead enrichment tools help teams to understand their audience better, and help create personalized experiences that can improve outcomes.
And lead enrichment tools automate the entire process to help sales teams identify quality leads.
Sales teams spend a considerable amount of time prospecting and qualifying leads, and lead enrichment tools can help automate the entire process to ensure teams spend more time in selling.
Although not all of the sales tools are directly tied to customer interactions, tools that aid internal teams' to flourish and maintain consistent communication are vital.
This is especially true given the new normal and the rise of remote sales teams.
Ideally, sales reps must be able to share resources, connect with each other without any hassle, and perform other internal tasks to move forward with a deal. Likewise, sales managers should have visibility into their team's performance and collaboration.
Having a communication tool will do the trick.
Tools such as Slack, Zoom, Trello, and Notion are adopted by sales teams across the globe to streamline internal communication and minimize back-and-forth's.
In addition to celebrating small wins and keeping the team up to date with company news, these tools are perfect to collaborate with folks from other departments too.
Sales teams should be able to communicate with one another asynchronously to improve connection, reduce lag times between responses, and contribute to a more productive work environment.
Sales automation tools can assist and simplify an enormous chunk of their workload on a daily basis.
The right automation tool can make generating and qualifying leads extremely easy. Every time a prospect enters the sales funnel, automation tools help the sales team engage leads and prospects with personalized content.
A CRM is an example of sales automation. With the right CRM, sales teams can leverage their several templates to write a personalized email based on triggers and nurture flows to drive them toward becoming a customer.
Automation tools such as Zapier lets you integrate hundreds of apps with one another in several ways to automate most functions.
Sales automation tools take the load off your sales reps' platter and can also act as an extra member of the team by engaging and closing leads.
Sales enablement tools are software applications or platforms that are designed to help sales teams be more effective in their roles. These tools can provide a range of features and functionality, such as document management, sales training and coaching, sales analytics and reporting, content creation and management, and customer relationship management (CRM). The goal of sales enablement tools is to improve the efficiency and productivity of sales teams, and to help them close more deals by providing them with the resources and information they need to succeed. Some examples of sales enablement tools include Salesforce, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Seismic.
What do your customers prefer - calls or emails?
And when is it “too soon” and when is it “too late” to contact a prospect? And are you pushing the leads too hard?
This where sales enablement and engagement tools can help you.
Sales enablement and engagement tools enable one to uncover key details about the lead, when to engage them, and the content that can create maximum engagement.
For instance, Salesken can help you gain insights about the customers, know their key concerns, and needs, and help you create nurturing strategies that will resonate best with the customers, improve engagement and outcomes.
Also, Salesken can help you identify the winning strategies of your top reps, and share them in real-time with the entire team. This improves sales teams’ productivity, and helps in reaching their revenue targets.
Sales scheduling tools enable companies an easy and efficient way to schedule meetings with prospects and customers.
We're all aware of the pressure of closing deals and how managers are always up to sales teams' necks to speed up their process.
The takeaway?
Identify sales opportunities for companies to close deals faster. This is possible with sales scheduling tools.
Modern sales tools help you assess who your hot leads are, and the best strategies to nurture them. A scheduler helps automate the routing process, and companies can now guide the leads to the qualified reps who are best suited to engage them and improve conversions.
Calendly is one such tool that helps lead schedule slots with your sales team directly without any hassle of a middleman. They can access your sales reps’ calendar directly, see your available slots, and book a meeting.
Easy peasy!
Another example of sales scheduling is chatbots to engage and re-route your customers on your behalf, allowing you ample time to prepare and respond accordingly.
AI tools can help automate customer engagement, answer customer queries and collect valuable information about the leads that can help sales teams know their customers better.
These tools, powered with AI and machine learning, get better at customer interactions and engage just like humans do. This will also personalize the buying experience and make your leads feel heard and valued, and improves the chances of conversions.
Social tools such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram are getting a lot of attention of late.
It's 2023, and it's the way a lot of salespeople, especially millennials enter the sales ranks.
Social media is one of the best and proven methods to increase website traffic and ultimately, sales. Internet tools have changed the rules of the game when it comes to sales, marketing, and customer expectations.
With every information available at customers' fingertips, social media has made it easier and also, complicated for sales managers. Data has always been the forefront runner in the sales process, and yet, social media made it way easier to access customer data while automation tools can facilitate the analysis of data imported, allowing you to focus on data-driven sales.
Identify key customers, their likes, interests, background, and more details needed to target them and focus on building a high-quality presence.
Salespeople can easily connect with their prospects by just following them on social media. When identifying the prospects, make use of keywords meant to search your clients active from your respective industry.
Another way to drive more sales is by turning your existing clients into your brand advocates - reach out to them and offer to promote your product in exchange for a freebie, or a discount.
Social media can increase brand visibility, and help salespeople build long-lasting relationships with prospects and customers. This can further boost your chances of driving sales from social channels.
The attention span of an average visitor to a website is short, and if they aren't engaged in a short time, they leave immediately.
This is where chatbots come into play.
It's quite impossible for a human to sit at a desk all day and respond to every inquiry that comes their way. As demand for personalization and instant communication is on the rise, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular and more sophisticated for all businesses.
Customers usually complain about chatbots providing answers in the most bot-like manner, however, modern chatbots are powered by AI and machine learning to respond to every query in a human-like language.
With customers expecting a detailed answer to their questions and complaints, as sales leaders you can train your chatbots to meet your customers' needs, thus increasing your chances to bring in more sales!
Chatbots have the ability to respond to customer queries, understand their behavior and interests, and suggest available options - and, all of this is automated.
Sales chatbots enable you to push your leads further down the funnel with little or no human interference. They're also equipped with huge benefits - cost-cutting to avoid hiring a human agent and they're always on time!
When choosing sales technology to automate sales and marketing activities across your organization, many factors are considered like price, features, integrations, and support.
Whether it be a CRM, a website, or more, you need to be sure before signing that contract.
Here are 4 primary factors to consider when choosing sales technology -
For most, privacy and security are often the deal breaker when it comes to choosing a sales tech. There's no need to waste either's time if one of the criteria doesn't meet your requirements.
It's absolutely vital to understand the privacy implications of software under any consideration.
Some of the key privacy features to look out for before considering a tool are - SOC 2 compliance, GDPR compliant, and other basic privacy settings. If this sounds like a lot of trouble, reassess the tool again.
Getting hacked is bad business and bad for public relationships. Take your time out to ensure you're sure before choosing the tool.
Most sales and marketing tools have proven to help businesses capture the right kind of leads and convert them at a lower cost, making it sound like an investment plan for your business.
However, the rise of unexpected costs can quickly cut you off your budget goals.
On the contrary, free or low-cost solutions do not always come with the support or features you need to fully utilize the tool for optimum performance. It can quickly become a hassle than it's worth when you discover that the tool won't help you out like you intended to.
It's a balancing act - prices, features, support, and ease of use are some key considerations to make before choosing the software for your business.
It is possible that certain tools can be specialized only for specific tasks. Conversational AI tools, prospecting tools, sales enablement tools and others are ones that have a specific purpose, and it can help optimize specific functions that need improvements.
But, before you pick the tool, you need to ensure that it integrates with your current tech stack to ensure seamless use of the product.
Else, you will need to spend additional time and resources to use the tool, which may outweigh the gains from using the particular technology.
Typically, all integrations are available on the website or make it a point to specifically check with the vendor if they integrate with your current tech stack.
Tools should be customizable based on your requirements and use case.
There could be a number of reasons why you want a particular feature or not.
From legal [data privacy issues] to practical [irrelevant use case], the vendors must be able to customize it as per your requirements.
And if the vendor is unable to show customization within a specific time frame, it is a red flag for you to move to other vendors or service providers.
Once your business is up and running, minor issues can glitch up your entire day. Understanding the type of support the vendor provides often prevents major headaches, in case an issue arrives.
Understand what type of support your teams are okay with - do you need phone support, or prefer live chat or email correspondence?
Is access to 24/7 support an absolute must? Or, do you prefer to get it done during business hours?
Before choosing the software, make sure to try all kinds of support and gauge their responses based on response time, frequency of replies, and the language and tone of voice used as part of your vetting process.
Once you've got your process ironed out and implemented sales and marketing tools with your business, you'll want everything to be running smoothly.
This checklist should be your top priority when choosing new sales tools. Although every company is different, and so are their operations, ultimately, you'll need to fine-tune your checklist that works for your business.
Even before COVID-19, organizations across the globe have been adopting and integrating sales technology to be at par with the buyers' behavior.
However, in the wake of the pandemic, consumer behavior changed drastically forcing businesses to adopt quicker and retrieve deeper insights into their sales data to drive maximum sales performance.
These sales insights do not suffice the current market trends to provide the best customer services and exceed their sales goals.
Here are four sales technology trends to watch out for -
Selling has changed drastically over the last few years.
With social selling, businesses across the globe can easily connect with prospects and customers from any geography with accurate targeting that would greatly benefit from your product.
A huge part of business communication happens on social media and through communication channels, let's say chatbots.
There's no other time to get on social media to get your customers to notice you than now.
Social selling improves brand visibility by actively engaging with prospects and customers online, which keeps your brand on top of their minds. This means, getting higher quality leads with high conversion rates.
Some of the key social platforms that aid businesses to meet their quotas are LinkedIn and Twitter.
Sales teams have for long tried to automate tasks so that their teams can spend more time building relationships with the customers and improve conversions.
The rise in AI technologies have made it possible for sales reps to automate much of their routine, admin tasks.
From CRM entries, note taking during calls, automated lead scoring, identifying lead intent, much of the tasks has been automated and the insights thus gathered is being leveraged by sales teams to provide a personalized buying experience for the buyers and improve conversions.
Sales automation technologies not only improve sales outcomes, but help improve employee morale and satisfaction, and reduce attrition.
With inflation at its peak since the 1980s and supply chains severely disrupted, top business leaders are worried about rising consumer costs.
As a result, CSOs across the globe are observing consumer, product, and transactions of sales data to understand how they impact consumer behavior.
By leveraging AI, dynamic pricing models are being built and adjusted in real-time across organizations all over.
With most B2B companies, pricing software can be grouped together contingent to their industry, past purchases, lenience towards a sale, and other factors to provide maximum transparency while negotiating deals.
Pricing prediction will be a critical factor in the coming years for driving peak sales performance in the wake of the rising inflation.
Even before the pandemic, most companies were, by and large, adopting digital technologies.
But, this peaked during the pandemic to drive optimum sales performance.
Consumers have started taking a digital first approach to buying, and sales teams must be able to personalize the buying experience to stand out from the competition. Teams need to adopt tools that can better understand customer needs, and provide the exact information that the customer is looking for at each stage of the funnel to ensure maximum success.
With this in mind, teams need to review their current sales processes, and add in technologies that can help optimize them to stand out from the crowd and close more deals.
The digital age is here and unless businesses recognize the value of being digital-first, we may find ourselves left behind.
A great deal of B2B companies in the recent past are well integrated with forward-thinking sales strategies, including AI-leveraged chatbots, sales automation, machine learning, and more.
Top sales professionals not only leverage sales technology to witness peak performance but also ensure that the same is used to achieve better results.

Questions such as "How to increase sales?" and "How to be successful in sales?" are the most recurring issues that consistently run through a sales rep's mind.
Let's face it: selling a product is tough.
Additionally, business owners are cognizant of the fact that increasing sales is crucial for their company's growth. If there's one metric that actually measures the health quotient of a company, then it's by gauging its sales volume.
To reach the maximum potential, a company must have effective strategies to increase the number of customers and ultimately, improve sales.
Globally, businesses are constantly looking to increase their sales numbers which continues to remain an uphill task. Several products and businesses have been developed to assist other businesses to improve and meet their sales targets.
If you're looking for tips to boost sales for your business, you're at the right place!
In this blog, we'll discuss why increasing sales is important and 10 go-to tips to boost sales for any business in 2023, big or small.
Let's begin.
Sales growth measures the change in revenue of an organization over a fixed time period - say between 2 quarters or between 2 months. growth measures how quickly a company has been growing its revenue, or sales.
It is calculated as using the formula:
A positive sales growth indicated operational efficiency, and high confidence of the customers with the particular company. While a negative growth rate could imply that the organizations need to improve its processes to remain sustainable.
Sales are essentially, the number of goods and products that were sold in a particular time period by a business. Typically, a person or a company conveys their interest in the product, or services you are selling and will offer money to get that for themselves.
When the transaction is done, and the product is handed over to the person, a sale is made.
As we're all aware, sales are the primary source of revenue for a company. Without substantial sales growth, a company will suffer a steep loss in terms of revenue, sometimes leading to acquisition of the company, or shutting it down altogether.
In addition, it also plays a vital role for the company to withstand the market trends.
Sales leaders that learn and acclimatize processes to maximize their sales and build lasting relationships with their customers grow to become a large, successful company.
Sales teams are not the only team responsible for increasing sales - it is a collective effort by teams of all departments. Leaders of a company should jot down an exhaustive plan that consists of a set of actions every department needs to compete and win against their competitors.
The following tips will help you move from interest to engagement to conversion, and thus boost sales this year. Let's start.
Customers are a company's most important asset.
Understanding their needs, pain points, challenges, fears, and desires can help you go a long way, and also sell your product with ease.
When you genuinely engage with your prospects and listen to their questions and shortcomings, you have a chance to understand their concerns better. This not only helps you build lasting relationships with your customers but also improves your product.
When you engage with your customers to genuinely help them out and not to make a sale, you build loyalty and gain their trust because you served them well.
Another way to understand your customers well, including potential and existing customers, is by sending out surveys to help understand how well they like your service and share their opinions, too.
Based on their inputs, you can make necessary changes to your processes and product, if needed.
We're all aware of customer rewards programs, and a ton of businesses have it in place, and for a good reason.
Having a simple discount, referral program, and add-ons can go a long way. Incentivize and offer a reward every time your customer completes a milestone such as providing customer testimonials, or is leveraging your product regularly.
Done right, rewards programs can help build customer loyalty and also, increase sales.
A business cannot thrive on its own.
All companies need a consistent and strong marketing plan to reach its customers. Create a marketing plan that leverages all omni channels, including digital and physical channels such as social media, customer testimonials, offline marketing, and more.
Having a consistent marketing plan that aligns with the sales process can help you receive more leads that match your services, promote the product so prospects are aware of its existence, increase sales, and more.
Leverage free resources such as Google to maximize your reach to new customers and ensure your company appears in the search results.
Google My Business is a free tool by Google that can be used to set up your business profile and jot down your services that help prospects learn more about you and your product.
Your company profile will appear in the local section of Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Knowledge Panel. Optimize your listing to stand out against your competitors by following easy tips and practices, and thus, stay on top of the listing.
Encourage your existing customers to provide customer testimonials, and reviews and when done, reward them. It's a win-win!
It's ubiquitous that selling to existing customers is 10 times easier and affordable than selling to new customers.
To make this a possibility, try increasing the cart value and review your current price. Look for complimentary products that can be added with the current purchase, and increase the frequency of purchases.
Although this may be dependent on the niche of your business, nonetheless, provide more value by offering exclusive deals and promotions for customers to return more often.
A lot of customers struggle with payment options provided by an organization.
Sometimes, payment choices provided are not usually compatible with every customer, especially if they belong to different geographies.
Some prefer credit cards, some net banking, while others prefer digital methods such as PayPal or Apple Pay.
If you provide only standard options such as credit card payment methods, you are essentially limiting the pool of customers to credit card holders. Include other popular payment choices to improve sales and allow potential customers to make purchases with the payment method they prefer.
Team selling is one of the most popular ways to close a deal and gain your customers' trust.
There are a variety of ways to indoctrinate this technique. Team selling allows you to keep important people in your sales process informed, exchange ideas together to provide value in your offerings, and establish authority.
Have two sales reps work together on one deal, or introduce a senior manager to answer important questions about the product. You can even split up teams into pairs of reps based on their performance for a contest to improve sales.
While one-off purchases may help boost sales over the short term, however, continued spending from loyal customers add up to your revenue over time.
It's worth calculating lifetime customer value (LCV) to understand how much customers buy and spend over time. Based on this, you can then adjust your sales process to match.
Know that, for buyers who are satisfied with your services or product, less work is required to drive more purchases.
Prioritize these buyers by including special offers, reducing price by offering discounts, and enhancing their experience so customers trust you and your team.
What are the odds that you aren't the only organization selling your product?
Learning and analyzing your competitors is critical to be able to explain the benefits your customers will receive after purchasing your services.
It is not uncommon to expect questions such as "How are you better than your competitors?". It is better to develop your competition advantage than be dumbfounded during a live call.
Conduct a simple research and get answers to questions such as : ‍"How is my competition selling their products and what are their claims?", "What are the benefits they are selling?", "How are our services different?", "How can I get better?", and more.
Picking the right price for your service is necessary to the long term success of your business.
Pick too low a price, and you may find it hard to remain sustainable, and pick too high a price, your competition could simply capture the market by offering a lower price.
The price you pick should depend on the potential of your customer, the positioning of your brand and the price quoted by your competitors.
Luxury brands are typically priced higher than the ones used for large-scale consumption, as they create a sense of exclusivity and the people who use the service or product would derive satisfaction from using a non-common brand.
In this case, the volume of sales will be low.
Of course, it totally goes without saying that the quality of the service offered or the product should match the price charged.
Similarly, commodities of mass consumption are priced lower to attract more customers, and generate higher volume of sales, and revenue.
Do not let stale selling strategies foul up your year or quarter.
It's 2023 and it is of the utmost importance to keep up with the latest sales and marketing trends to improve sales. Infuse new life into your existing sales process by practicing new techniques listed above.
In doing so, you'll not only access greater heights in your role, but also nurture a strong sales team, enhance close rates, and foster lasting connections with customers who feel appreciated, and thus, boosting sales.
If you're looking to improve your closing rates and boost sales in more ways than just one, jump on the bandwagon of intuitive sales tool. Book a demo with Salesken today and get started!

B2B sales representatives are among the most valuable resources for any organisation’s sales team. They are responsible for building an effective sales workflow from the research to the conversion stage and are the key driving force behind activities like customer acquisition, relationship building, and closing high-value deals.
Read on to learn what it takes to become a successful B2B sales representative!
B2B sales representatives play a different role than B2C sales representatives. B2C sales reps generally follow the organisational sales playbook to align with the sales processes, search for prospects’ backgrounds, and pitch solutions that address potential customers’ challenges.
B2B sales reps are responsible for building and nurturing connections with corporate decision-makers to sell various products and services. They do so through channels like sales calls, video conferencing and emails.
Business-to-business sales is all about selling products and services to other businesses instead of directly selling to customers. B2B sales is different from B2C sales as the sales cycle is longer, involves multiple touchpoints, and decision-makers, and the product being sold tends to be of higher value. As a result, one may need up to 3 months or longer to close a B2B sales deal.
Since B2B sales involves multiple decision-makers, each with their unique needs, the reps must handle every key stakeholder objection and allay their concerns to close the deal. Hence the term "complex sale" is associated with B2B sales.
For example, suppose a B2B sales development representative is selling project management software to the C-suite of a company. Different stakeholders in the prospects’ buying team (for example, the technology team, finance team, etc.) have different requirements and concerns regarding the software.
For instance, the finance team may care about budget-friendly pricing. The integration team may ask questions are the various channel or platform integrations. The projects team may want to know if it accommodates up to 100 users.
In such a situation, B2B sales representatives can successfully close the deal by building a package that matches the diverse requirements of various stakeholders. To do that, the sales representatives should have a clear idea of the key decision-makers and their requirements.
Business-to-business sales representatives are responsible for end-to-end management of B2B sales funnel, starting from lead generation to lead conversion. Some of the major responsibilities associated with B2B sales representatives include:
Here is a quick overview of the B2B sales process that B2B sales representatives follow:
The first step of the B2B sales and marketing cycle is research. B2B reps conduct a thorough investigation into the businesses that are most likely to benefit from the products and services, the demographics of the target prospects and the best ways to reach them. They must detect the key decision-maker in an organisation and connect with them directly. To learn this information, B2B reps explore multiple platforms like social media, websites, news portals, review portals, etc.
Prospecting is related to sending a cold email or making a cold call to prospective customers and building their interest. This stage helps them gain an idea about the readiness of the prospect to purchase the product or service.
In this stage, one performs a quick need assessment to identify the product-prospect fit. Some common areas to focus on in the discovery call include the prospect’s current issues, business objectives and budget. Once everyone has clear information on these aspects, suitable outreach strategies can be developed.
Once the needs of the prospect have been identified, the reps pitch the product. The sales representative is well aware of the prospect's challenges, and the pitch should proactively address the key needs and concerns of the prospects.
Prospects raise multiple objections in this stage. The more complex the solution, the more objections multiple stakeholders raise. But with proper preparation, reps can handle the objections and move the deal to the next stages.
Want to tackle objections like a pro? Check out how Salesken's real-time assistance can help with objection handling and closing the sale.
B2B selling is a prolonged, complex process. The sales reps need to negotiate with the corporate buyers a few times before closing deals. These requests can be related to pricing, features, implementation, and so on. The sales rep needs to negotiate all the terms and conditions correctly with the prospects to freeze the final deal.
In the B2B sales process, conversion is crucial. Many prospective B2B sales deals don’t convert into paid deals at this stage even after significant progress. The ones that do convert offer disproportionate returns on the overall effort. Therefore, planning and executing a smooth customer onboarding is mandatory in this stage.
The job of B2B sales representatives is challenging. Successful corporate sales representatives should possess and acquire the following sales skills to convert the challenges of B2B sales into opportunities:
Empathy is the #1 sales skill. It is a must for the B2B sales representatives to create a rapport with the corporate buyers, identify their needs and concerns, and offer suitable solutions. B2B reps with remarkable EQ don’t hesitate to admit if their products are not the perfect fit for the buyers. Addressing potential customers’ pain points is the top priority in B2B sales.
Active listening is an underrated professional skill. The sales rep must hear the prospect out before formulating their pitch. Remember, when you listen to the prospective customer, you hear their specific challenges, you can establish a genuine rapport, earn their trust and then provide the best solutions.
Corporate sales representatives are bound to face rejection and hear the word “no” a lot. Therefore, developing persistence skills is a must for sales reps. This trait helps the reps to remain motivated even after facing rejections. By being persistent, sales reps can stay objective, not personalise the rejection, and use the feedback to improve their outreach activities.
Sales reps are responsible for multiple activities like research, cold outreach, discovery calls, demo calls, and so on. Efficient time management is key to balancing all these tasks simultaneously and prioritising better.
Research is a major part of B2B selling and customer acquisition. A professional involved in selling should possess in-depth analytical skills to collect sufficient information about a business, its key stakeholders, its competitive positioning, and the current pain points they are facing.
Sales negotiation is not just about the discussion over the price but is a continuous affair starting from need identification, objection handling, finding solutions, and price discussions. Often, reps assume good negotiation is all about making the prospect accept their view. But, good negotiation is often about finding the middle ground and a solution acceptable to all the key stakeholders. Reps need to possess negotiation skills to ensure they can build genuine rapport with the prospects and win more deals.
Sales reps don’t need to be tech experts, but basic technical skills are a must to win deals. Buyers would never prefer to purchase from a rep who is unable to answer basic technical queries about the product. It is thus important for the reps to know what technology the product uses, data security, integrations, and other information to gain the trust of the prospect.
Sales reps should be able to create genuine rapport and be able to network with a wide variety of people. With strong networking skills, businesses can generate new leads, nurture relationships and create unlimited customer acquisition opportunities for their brand.
Sales reps must never mislead the prospect. Falsifying information or providing the prospect with incomplete information may move the deal down the funnel, but sooner or later, the prospect will figure it out and it will end up damaging the organisation's reputation in the market. It is always better to be honest, and upfront with the prospect about the product capabilities. If one is unable to answer a prospect's query, it is always better to accept it and get back to them later or seek help from others and provide the correct response to the prospect.
In modern sales, social media has become a dominant mode of selling, and reps must be able to leverage social media channels to nurture and convert leads. With social listening tools like Hootsuite and others, reps can now know who their ICPs are, what they are searching for, and their key needs and concerns. Reps with an active social media presence can then use the channels to educate the buyers about their product to their target customers. Also, social media can be a great way to network and create brand awareness.

Choosing the right words is crucial in sales. And why words are so important can be summed up with this beautiful quote:
So, yes. The words your sales reps use when talking to prospects are extremely potent, as choosing the right ones can help them win more deals, while the wrong ones can hurt their chances of meeting the monthly quota.
1. Client’s name ‍
People are naturally attentive when you address them directly. Using the prospect’s name makes them feel that you are offering bespoke solutions. Research suggests that specific parts of our brain get activated when we hear our own name. Use the prospect’s name more often to close deals faster.
‍2. You ‍
The best sales pitch phrases put the customers and their needs at the center of the conversation. Using the word ‘you’ repeatedly helps maintain intimacy and keeps them engaged.
‍3. We ‍
Emphasizing the word ‘we’ can help break down barriers and enhance cooperation. It lets prospects know that you have a mutually beneficial relationship.
‍4. Imagine ‍
Power words for sales like ‘imagine’ can help you describe the benefits of your product/service while enabling prospects to visualize the bigger goals you can help them achieve. ‍
5. Thank you ‍
Whether during calls, in writing, or through actions, being polite sets you up for a friendlier relationship. ‍
6. Welcome ‍
Just as with ‘thank you', be generous in expressing your appreciation with ‘welcome’. Saying ‘you’re welcome’ is better than saying ‘no problem’.
7. Value ‍
Always find a way to contextualize your offerings according to the prospect’s needs. Personalization is key to doing business successfully in the new normal. According to a study, 80% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand that provides personalized experiences.
‍8. Advantage/Benefit ‍
‘Advantage’ and ‘benefit’ are sales buzzwords that reiterate your value proposition with clear reasoning as to why customers should opt for your offering over your competitor’s.
9. Help ‍
There is no better way to build trust than by helping customers beyond the purchasing process. Be sure to deliver if you are called upon. ‍
10. Do ‍
Experts suggest that using positive sales words such as ‘do’ instead of ‘try’ will make you seem more capable and reliable, and inspire confidence in your product/service. ‍
11. Amazing ‍
Customers don’t want to settle for something good; they want to be wowed! Use power words for sales such as ‘amazing’, ‘remarkable’, and ‘wonderful’ when you can deliver on the expectation.
12. Tips ‍
Additional information that can benefit customers will always get you brownie points. Use them wisely to add value without disclosing too much.
13. Avoid ‍
When used appropriately, your pitch could give a positive spin to sales words that are generally considered negative. This word can let them know that you are there to help them minimize wastage, whether it is cost, time, or effort. ‍
14. Proven ‍
Sales words such as ‘proven’, ‘genuine’, ‘authentic’, and ‘endorsed’ can help build trust. With increasing competition, customers want to partner with a brand they can rely on. When you use the word ‘proven’, it tells the customer that your product or service is market-tested and effective.  ‍
15. Safe ‍
It is important to inspire confidence and credibility with strong sales words such as ‘safe’ and ‘secure’ to let prospects know they are in good hands.
16. Because ‍
The conjunction allows you to bring customers’ focus to the reasoning or benefits for a particular offering, consciously connecting the two. And research suggests that people like to be given a reason or justification for things they are told.
17. Results ‍
Using definitive words like ‘results’, ‘guarantee’, or ‘authentic’ make customers feel comfortable investing in a product or service that seems likely to deliver on its promise. ‍
18. Or ‍
This can be a subtle way to make the prospect see your point of view or present them with alternatives, multiplying your chances of cracking a deal. ‍
19. Improved ‍
Products/services must adapt to changing customer preferences and needs. Using the word 'improved' can help you highlight how the new version of your products is better than ever before. ‍
20. I don’t know ‍
Sales phrases like this show prospects that you are honest and not afraid of admitting that you don’t know everything. Follow this up with “I will let you know soon” to show that you are willing to help the prospect further.
21. Fair
Humans have a natural desire to be perceived as fair and get what is fair. Make an offer or ask for something and follow it up with “Is that fair?”. When used 1.7x per deal, ‘Fair’ helps superstar sales reps move it forward to the next stage.
‍‍22. Remember ‍
'Remember' is a very useful word for reconnecting with past leads, reiterating the main features of your offerings, or reminding prospects of past promises (such as to close a deal sooner, maybe).
23. And ‍
Skillfully replace ‘but’ with ‘and’ when addressing a concern or criticism. ‘And’ when followed with the relevant information is one of the most useful sales transition phrases that bring inclusivity into your statements, even in scenarios where you may be disagreeing with the prospect.
‍24. Hurry Provide your prospects with a limited time offer they cannot resist. If they seem convinced, ask them to hurry so they don’t miss a good deal.
25. Free ‍
One of the most persuasive sales words, offering a part of the service or add-on benefit for ‘free’ can decrease the cost while increasing your offering’s perceived value.
26. Save ‍
Everyone wants to save on money, time, or resources. Back it up with a clear opportunity, and you could get a customer on board for the long-term.
27. Exclusive ‍
Sales buzzwords such as ‘exclusive’, ‘rare’, or ‘limited edition’ create the impression that your offering is unique and available only to a select few.
28. First ‍
This is another word that denotes exclusivity or brings in the wow factor. If you can deliver on the first-mover advantage, you can build a long-lasting relationship with customers.
29. Successful ‍
Top performers use ‘successful’ 4-6x per hour on a sales call. Follow their success mantra and close deals faster!
30. Simple/Easy ‍
From onboarding customers, using your product/service, and getting adequate support – if you can simplify the customer experience, they may be more willing to sign up with you.
31. Premium ‍
Sales words that denote luxury and prestige help grab attention. Customers respond to concepts of high esteem, value, and quality as it makes them feel privileged. ‍
32. Confidential ‍
Strong sales words such as ‘confidential’, ‘secret’, or ‘insider’ tap into natural human curiosity and serve to intrigue prospects. You can use these sales words to pique their interest and genuinely engage them. ‍
33. Risk-free This term acts as an assurance for customers to know that they are not going to lose anything, especially when they are signing up for a free demo or trial. Those were some of the most powerful words to sell a product.
34. We provide ‍
Prospects anticipate a sales pitch and stop listening the moment you say, ‘we provide’. Close rates fall by 22% when sales reps use it four or more times in a single call. ‍
35. Problem Hearing the word ‘problem’ immediately incites a negative reaction. When referring to an issue that the customer may face, use ‘challenge’ or ‘hurdle’ instead. ‍
36 Honestly Although a positive-sounding word, ‘honestly’ can have a negative connotation in a sales language. When overused, this word could make the prospect feel like everything else you have said before may not be true.
‍37. Hopefully/Maybe These words are vague and do not instill confidence. They indicate that you are unsure of what you are saying or promising. If you are not confident of your product/service’s benefits, why would prospects be?
‍38. Discount Don’t offer a 33% discount; instead, offer 50% more of the same product at the same price! Discounts devalue your products and can decrease your chances of closing a deal by 17%. ‍
39. Obviously ‘Obviously’ sounds condescending. It sounds like you are undermining the client’s intelligence by stating the obvious. ‍
40. Cheap Using ‘cheap’ undervalues your offering. It gives the feeling that your product or service is substandard. Say ‘cost-effective’ or ‘economical’ instead. ‍
41. Free Trial Substitute ‘free trial’ with ‘demo’ or ‘pilot’ if you are not looking to lower your chances of moving to the next stage by 5%. ‍
42. Competitor It is best not to bring up competitors unless the prospect does so. Putting down your competitors reflects poorly on you and your company. Instead, talk about how your offerings are at par with industry standards and how you can exceed their expectations. ‍
43. Quota Never mention that you are doing the job for incentives or fulfilling your quota. It can make prospects think you are only trying to close a deal even if it’s not a good fit for them. ‍
44. Objections When addressing queries from prospects, avoid categorizing them as objections. Call it a ‘concern’ or ‘challenge’ and show them that you are willing to address any issues. ‍
45. Prospects Do not refer to your prospects as ‘prospects’. You will immediately make them feel dehumanized and disconnected. ‍
46. Perfect Is it okay to reinforce how ‘perfect’ everything about your deal is? When used more than four times during a call, the advance rate drops by 16%. ‍
47. Pitch Even though you are technically pitching to your prospect, it is a very salesy term that implies you are there to sell a product instead of helping them find the right solutions. Say ‘presentation’ or ‘discussion’ instead. ‍
48. Cutting-edge/Innovative These are some of the most overused sales words, as every company tries to position itself as cutting-edge or innovative. ‍
49. Erm  Constantly making sounds such as ‘erm’, ‘ah’, or ‘uhh’ make prospects feel you have not come prepared. They also make you sound unprofessional and unsure. ‍
50. Don’t  ‘Don’t’ is negative. No one likes to hear what they should not do. Instead, tell them what they should do. ‍
51. But When you make a positive statement, using ‘but’ means you are contradicting what you said previously. This creates dissonance in the prospect’s mind. ‍
52. Show you how Spend more time on ‘why’ rather than ‘how’ something works. If you use such sales phrases more than four times in a call, your close rate may drop by 13%.
Salesken is a tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to identify meaning and emotion reflected by words that are spoken during sales calls. It then uses this data to help reps say the right words or avoid using the wrong ones – in real-time! You can even manually feed these words into Salesken, so it can help your reps have more powerful sales conversations and win more deals.
Salesken also provides sales leaders like you with post-call analytics to track your sales team’s performance. Salesken records and annotates sales calls so you can quickly navigate through them with ease. You can tie it back to sales people wanting to close deals as they can earn over $300,000 per year, as evidenced by sales salary site CompGauge, ‘Fair’ helps superstar sales reps move it forward to the next stage.
What’s more, in addition to metrics such as the number of calls or talk ratio, Salesken lets you see if your sales team is using the right words and how often, whether they are saying anything wrong to your prospects, and how they can improve their performance.

Salesken’s wide capabilities mine customer conversations and provide valuable insights to provide a holistic view of deals in your pipeline and pick up on signs to work on before it’s too late. Get ahead of your agenda and always stay on track with accurate forecasting.

We don’t see any reason for your team members to be behind their quotas with Salesken’s performance intelligence feature.

Use Salesken to gauge your sales reps’ performance in real-time with predictive analytics reports to pinpoint activities that might lead to better learnings and outcomes. Expedite a faster onboarding process with the use of actual sales conversations and not a workflow, so you do not have to watch your sales reps make a mistake on a live call.

What if we told you that Salesken makes this dream a reality? Get high-level, data-oriented insights with Salesken to understand how several of your buyer personas react to your strategic messaging and positioning, how well your team is leveraging sales enablement assets and GTM strategies are being used to their maximum advantage.

In this age of digitalization, it is essential for companies and start-ups to find new technologies to help them grow faster and quicker. Sales Management Software can streamline and optimize your workflow to interact with your clients and customers. Here are 6 key reasons to try Salesken:
Whether you’re a small business or a large enterprise, a call tracking software can be a valuable tool for understanding which marketing channels are driving phone calls, and ultimately, sales. ‍ The Salesken platform automates the process of handling calls, leads, clicks, email, SMS, and bookkeeping among other things. Using Salesken, you can track calls, send emails, manage leads, and make use of cloud-based communication systems. The system allows organizations to automate and fine-tune their marketing activities and collect essential call data. Additionally, it provides marketing analytics and optimizes conversion rates and ROI. The Salesken platform can help businesses track and analyze phone calls. By tracking calls, businesses can see which marketing campaigns are driving phone calls, what keywords are being used to find the business, and most importantly, how prospects interact with the business. It can also help businesses track sales calls and customer service calls and analyze call data to improve call center operations.
Salesken analyzes every single customer interaction to provide actionable insights and can help optimize every aspect of your sales process.
With Salesken, you can track each visitor across multiple sessions as well as marketing variables such as source, channel, campaign, and keyword.
Using lead attribution analysis, you can identify which marketing channels are bringing qualified leads to your company at each stage. Future marketing efforts will be less effective unless you know which marketing funnel generates the most returns, and this offers a great way to analyze the leads.
With Salesken’s software, you can generate detailed analytical reports that help you better understand your sales data and ROI. This data provides you with a unique and increased level of insight into your critical call tracking solution. It is easier to understand, analyze, and interpret statistics that are visually appealing.
It takes time to keep track of everything that happens within your project, but with Salesken’s call tracking software, you can automatically receive daily reports via email.

Have you ever wondered how call tracking software works?
Cloud-based call monitoring software allows marketers to link clients' digital travels to phone calls by collecting data online via unique, trackable phone numbers.
A website tag allows for Salesken’s call monitoring and analytics. The tag is a piece of code that is installed on a website and replaces regular, static phone numbers with dynamic numbers that are unique to each site visitor.
When a customer dials a Salesken-provided phone number, the call is routed through the Salesken platform to a call center, a local agent, or any other destination.
Salesken can then aggregate the digital data and link the callers' previous activity to the phone call. This occurs almost instantly, with no interruption to the caller's experience.
A Call Tracking Software is designed to help businesses streamline and improve their operations. But with so many options on the market, how do you know which one is right for your business?
Salesken offers subscription-based, monthly, annual, and user-based pricing, making it incredibly appealing to customers.
Salesken is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so you don't have to worry about the support—it’s unparalleled.
Its platform is simple to use and can be readily integrated with other sales tools.

A better way to determine whether productivity is increasing is to track phone conversations. It is achieved by analyzing the insight provided by call data, which makes it easier for an analyst to analyze the performance of a team.
Businesses require successful marketing campaigns to develop their business and increase their customer base. Investing in ineffective marketing initiatives will only waste time and resources. They must measure their campaigns to find out what works and what doesn't. But how can they determine which marketing plan is the most effective for them? Using call tracking software, businesses can easily collect this information by analyzing various marketing efforts. This allows them to maximize their ROI.
Call monitoring software enables marketers to collect data from phone calls with clients that may be used to prove which marketing campaign or approach prompted the call and what the outcome of the call was.
There are a few call metrics that sales teams should track. The first is the number of calls made per day. This will help to ensure that the sales team is making enough calls to reach their goals. The second metric is the number of appointments set per day. This metric will help to ensure that the sales team is productive and making appointments that will turn into sales. The third metric is the number of sales made per day. This metric will help in ensuring that the sales team meets its goals.

#1 Sales Forecasting Software

Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









The sales forecasting tool gives you complete visibility into your sales activities that allow you to make informed decisions about everything. From inventory to staffing to marketing efforts and defining product lines, it collects data and analyzes all factors involved. Furthermore, it allows sales managers to identify any bottlenecks in achieving the target and help rectify them by making necessary adjustments to their approach and strategy, thus, bringing in more leads.
The best sales forecasting tool analyzes all current and past data to help with accurate forecasting. It empowers businesses to accurately estimate their costs and revenue by considering current and possible market demands. This allows companies to establish proper profit plans and income flows. It also helps determine the additional resource requirements, if any, in the long run, and prevents the last-minute panic.
Companies can allocate their resources across different functional departments and teams for increased optimization and amplified performance. If the forecast looks promising for the upcoming quarter, sales managers can better incentivize their sales reps and offer more discounts to their customers to improve conversions while staying profitable. Similarly, if the prediction doesn’t look good, more resources can be allocated to the marketing departments to help with more lead generation.
Sales forecasting helps you determine whether or not you need to start hiring or put a pin on your recruitment plans. If you are planning to launch a new product in the upcoming quarter, you might require a bigger task force. This is when your team considers amplifying the hiring process. Similarly, if your sales forecasts predict an increase in demand, companies need to allocate proper resources and budget towards hiring and obtaining manpower to meet those numbers. And if the demand is expected to be low, you may want to pause your hiring plans and focus on the business process instead.
When you do a sales forecast, it gives you a clear picture of how many deals your sales team needs to close in order to achieve the revenue target. The same data helps you determine how many prospects you need in your pipeline to be in good shape. Besides, better prospecting enables you to filter your leads or consumers out who don't align with your product or service.
The main task of a sales manager is to set achievable goals and ensure that all your team members are aligned. Sales forecasting helps you set realistic goals. The costs and revenue estimates lay the foundation for the entire strategy throughout the year. It provides a vision for the company and points out a better direction for the sales team.
Apart from meeting the monthly sales target, companies also need to keep satisfying their customers. When sales forecasts are achieved as planned, your company can also continue to fund external marketing activities such as organizing events, creating an omnichannel presence, and other activities to delight and connect with your customers.
Using historical and current data, sales forecast software tries to estimate achievable targets for your team. It also helps set a challenge for your sales team and keep them engaged. Besides, their performance can be tracked on an individual level, allowing sales managers to keep a tab on each performance and reward the ones who help meet the estimated number.

Who
It’s crucial to define who your prospects are. Depending on your buyer's persona, the sales forecast can get more accurate.
What
What are you planning to sell? A sales forecast is based on the solutions that you offer in relation to the problems that your prospects are facing.
where
It’s essential for the sales team to know where the buying decision is made and where the actual product will be used. For better forecasts, the sales team needs to get closer to the centre of the action.
why
Here, you need to know why prospects are buying your product over your competitors and vice versa. What is that gap between your solution and that of your competitors, making them consider your product now?
How
You need to be aware of how your target audience is making the purchase decisions. You need to account for how they make a decision.
Align With Marketing Teams
Based on the forecast data, you can notify the marketing team on the number of prospects that need to be targeted. Insights from sales forecasting help align your sales and marketing team.
Improve the Performance of your Reps
Sales forecasting software provides insights into how your reps are performing. You get complete visibility into each sales rep's activities and offer feedback whenever required.
Bring Your Stakeholders Onboard
Pulling future sales data from forecasting software can help you gain confidence from your investors and other stakeholders.
A Lack of Predictive Data
For accurate sales forecasts, it’s essential to have detailed historical data to work with. But unfortunately, not every organization, especially the newly established ones, have a substantial amount of historical data to run predictive analysis and come up with realistic numbers. Most of them rely on market research and competitive intelligence to base their forecasts. Having low-quality data can cause harm in the long-term sales challenges as the sales forecasting software can’t feed data to form predictive patterns. Investing in a platform like Salesken can help store and manage all your data and seamlessly integrate it with other data systems.
Technology Limitations
Most organizations have invested in sales tools to help boost their sales department performance. On average, sales organizations routinely use more than 10 sales technology tools. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the sales technology stack isn't integrated properly, including CRM. A lack of proper planning and integration is why sales forecast software cannot collect enough data and run an accurate prediction. Bring together all the right resources and follow a structured plan for implementing sales tools so that it leads to better performance.
Unpredictable Markets
A result of an unexpected event such as extreme weather, economic crisis, and global pandemic like COVID-19 can drastically change your sales forecasts. Besides, customers’ interests and behavior are constantly evolving and demand greater satisfaction, and to make matters worse, sales managers make decisions based on their gut feelings during such challenging times. This makes forecast accuracy even worse, and the expected revenue growth can completely take a back seat. Understanding these new patterns and regrouping customers according to the situation can improve sales forecasts.
Overestimating Forecast
Most of the reasons why reps are over-optimistic in their forecasts are psychological. They work in a highly competitive environment, and their wins and failures are heavily broadcasted on the leaders' board. The pressure makes it difficult to predict their future growth accurately. This stress and fear can make it even harder for the best reps to correctly forecast the sales revenue for the upcoming months. Thus, a sales forecasting tool is a must that helps you run a predictive analysis based on data and facts and doesn’t rely on human emotional bias.
Season Change
While forecasting sales, leaders forget to include the impact of change of seasonality that can have on consumers' buying behavior. Depending on your location, industry, location, and target audience, consumers might be more or less likely to buy at certain times of the year. For instance, SaaS companies generally give out a lot of discounts during the holiday seasons, which results in increased sales.

Here’s how forecasting can help your business.
Salesken turns your data into an arsenal that you can maximize to your advantage. All your conversations with your customers are unique and packed with powerful details about them, their interests, needs, and problem resolutions. Salesken’s engagement platform captures your team’s customer-facing conversations across multiple channels like phone, social media, or web conferences and analyzes them with AI. This, in turn, helps you build a winning sales strategy based on successful conversations.
Generally, there are two ways to predict your sales for the upcoming time period: top-down and bottom-up forecasting. As the name suggests, top-down forecasting analyzes future performance by studying high-level data and working down to revenue. On the other hand, bottom-up forecasting assesses low-level data to examine your company’s future performance. A sales manager will better identify the best method for your organization.
From revenue insights and predictability to delivering customer happiness.
Salesken eliminates the need to manually collect data into your spreadsheet to forecast multiple pipelines. Instead, use our sales forecasting software for seamless integration of data from various platforms, including your CRM, and get a visualized picture of your pipelines. The sales team can easily view the monthly or quarterly revenue, understand how each product is performing, and how far they are from reaching their targets.
Along with a visualized pipeline, Salesken gives you in-depth knowledge of your team’s and the overall sales department's performance. You can get a clear idea of how many deals were lost, won, and closed, how many deals are pending in the pipeline, which sales reps have closed the most sales, who needs improvement, and more. With Salesken’s sales forecasting solution, you can get all information you need to grow your revenue.
Salesken’s forecasting tool provides a clear picture of your targets and where you stand currently. This forecasting software is easy to use, customizable, and powerful. Its rich and intuitive interface makes it easy for everyone in the team, including those who are non-tech savvy, to efficiently use the platform and do what they do best.
With Salesken’s sales forecasting software, the sales team can maintain complete visibility into their sales pipeline. Complete pipeline visualization helps in better sales management as it provides a holistic view of relevant KPIs, helps in identifying potential bottlenecks, and streamlines sales activities. It helps build a streamlined workflow for you and your sales team that aligns with your business needs.
In order for accurate forecasting, Salesken’s sales forecasting software has to pull data from all data recording systems. The platform needs internal sales data, including call data, emails, chats, and more, to forecast and predict future growth. It enables seamless integration with other data systems you might use to record sales, including accounting applications and CRM, to collect and analyze data.
Not all sales calls end up in lead conversion. Salesken’s intelligence platform helps you determine which sales calls have the maximum impact on your leads and derive results. Our forecasting tool analyzes all your sales call and reps activities and tells you how you can increase the chance of converting leads into your customers.
Salesken has got you covered throughout the sales cycles—from qualifying leads to nurturing them for final conversion. Our sales intelligence data, when combined with AI-based suggestions, can help sales reps identify the contacts that are ready to buy. Thus, it reduces the average lead-to-close time and boosts the overall performance of your sales department.
Salesken’s AI-based forecasting tool helps sales decision-makers such as CFOs, CMOs, and other stakeholders involved by extracting specific insights from all customer/prospect interactions with utmost accuracy. Sales managers can use these insights to build better strategies and make business decisions that can lead to better engagement with prospects and improve their lead conversion ratio, resulting in increased revenue.
There are many possible risks involved in a sales pipeline—insufficient budgets, competitive pressure, unrealistic targets, etc. Sometimes salespeople are stuck in mundane tasks of data entry rather than picking up calls and following up with leads. With Salesken’s Sales forecasting software, you can track the current status of your sales goals and identify the gaps, if any. It also helps you identify any change in market demands so that you can adjust your sales planning accordingly and reach your goals.
Most of the time, prospects complain that the sales representatives do not realize their needs and try to push a solution that does not fit their requirements. Our sales forecasting tool analyzes all the past call recordings as well as present calls and reveals the areas or topics where leads are most responsive. With Salesken’s personalized sales strategies for every individual rep, identify leads' interests and steer the conversation towards those points in real time. Closing sales deals have never been this easier.
Using the insights from our sales forecast tools, salespeople can automatically identify which leads to prioritize. This helps save time by stopping them from chasing unqualified, low interest leads and increasing the chance of conversions. The platform helps you identify the accounts that are actively engaging and intend to purchase a product or service based on their behavior, interests, and the type of content they are consuming.
The best sales forecasting software helps managers track every individual's performance and identify opportunities to increase revenue.
To ensure maximum efficiency from a sales forecasting tool, it’s crucial to understand what impacts the forecast result. Here are a few common challenges that are typically faced during sales forecasting:
Sales forecasting requires a framework that needs to be revised from year to year. It involves three primary activities.
While running a sales forecast algorithm, you need to clearly define the estimated monetary amount and what the timeframes will be. Once you enter that data, the software pulls data from the same time period for the past years and starts running an analysis.
Sales forecasts can change at any given time due to unforeseen circumstances or events. Thus, it’s essential to review the estimates at key milestones, compare them with the current status, and revise if necessary.
While running a sales forecast analysis, take inputs from different team members. Ask different questions and take different angles of the data once in a while to find new and better ways to achieve a more accurate forecast.

A sales forecasting software solution is designed to help sales leaders and other decision-makers involved to predict the future growth of the company. It gathers and analyzes all past and present sales data, including call recordings, sales numbers, buyers' profiles, and others, to draw insights into revenue growth. Sales forecasting software is valuable for sizes and types of businesses. Some of the most popular sales forecasting solutions available in the market are Salesken, HubSpot Sales, and Pipedrive.
Sales forecasting software runs on a set of mathematical algorithms to predict the number of sales each product will have in a certain stipulated time period. It takes into account historical and present sales data to produce a forecast. Along with sales data, these algorithms also searched for market trends such as moving averages and seasonality. The sales forecast software then matches the algorithm with the trend of sales to each product and creates a sales forecast for the upcoming desired sales period. Based on this predictive analysis, sales forecasting software systems provide detailed reports on the sales estimates for the sales leaders to act upon.
You need to create a roadmap for choosing the right sales forecast software. Here’s how to do it. First, evaluate your business needs. Next, you dig deeper into the type of data you want to input into your system. This is essential because not every sales forecast platform is built for every kind of business. Second, you need to know how well the system integrates with other data systems, including your existing applications. Also, understand how easy it will be to migrate sales data from one system to another. Once you have all the information, you can look for sales forecast solutions with those features or talk to sales forecast software providers for a customized package for your business. Always consider how easy the software is to use and whether or not it falls into your budget category. You do not want to end up with software that will burn a hole in your pocket.
Having a sales forecast software like Salesken helps with accurate forecasting. Here are some of its benefits. An accurate sales forecast allows sales managers to efficiently allocate resources to increase revenue and manage their cash flow properly. Having reliable sales forecast software eliminates the guessing game and conveys confidence to the management and the board, as the predictions are based on data, not any gut feeling. Sales forecasting helps in strategic planning, which helps boost the overall performance of the sales department and makes it easy to achieve targets. Accurate forecasting sets benchmarks for future trends and allows sales leaders to structure and optimize their sales process to ensure more wins.

For accurate sales forecasts, it’s essential to have detailed historical data to work with. But unfortunately, not every organization, especially the newly established ones, have a substantial amount of historical data to run predictive analysis and come up with realistic numbers. Most of them rely on market research and competitive intelligence to base their forecasts. Having low-quality data can cause harm in the long-term sales challenges as the sales forecasting software can’t feed data to form predictive patterns.

For instance, SaaS companies generally give out a lot of discounts during the holiday seasons, which results in increased sales.

Here’s how forecasting can help your business.
Salesken turns your data into an arsenal that you can maximize to your advantage. All your conversations with your customers are unique and packed with powerful details about them, their interests, needs, and problem resolutions. Salesken’s engagement platform captures your team’s customer-facing conversations across multiple channels like phone, social media, or web conferences and analyzes them with AI. This, in turn, helps you build a winning sales strategy based on successful conversations.
Generally, there are two ways to predict your sales for the upcoming time period: top-down and bottom-up forecasting. As the name suggests, top-down forecasting analyzes future performance by studying high-level data and working down to revenue. On the other hand, bottom-up forecasting assesses low-level data to examine your company’s future performance. A sales manager will better identify the best method for your organization.
From revenue insights and predictability to delivering customer happiness.
Salesken eliminates the need to manually collect data into your spreadsheet to forecast multiple pipelines. Instead, use our sales forecasting software for seamless integration of data from various platforms, including your CRM, and get a visualized picture of your pipelines. The sales team can easily view the monthly or quarterly revenue, understand how each product is performing, and how far they are from reaching their targets.
Along with a visualized pipeline, Salesken gives you in-depth knowledge of your team’s and the overall sales department's performance. You can get a clear idea of how many deals were lost, won, and closed, how many deals are pending in the pipeline, which sales reps have closed the most sales, who needs improvement, and more. With Salesken’s sales forecasting solution, you can get all information you need to grow your revenue.
Salesken’s forecasting tool provides a clear picture of your targets and where you stand currently. This forecasting software is easy to use, customizable, and powerful. Its rich and intuitive interface makes it easy for everyone in the team, including those who are non-tech savvy, to efficiently use the platform and do what they do best.
With Salesken’s sales forecasting software, the sales team can maintain complete visibility into their sales pipeline. Complete pipeline visualization helps in better sales management as it provides a holistic view of relevant KPIs, helps in identifying potential bottlenecks, and streamlines sales activities. It helps build a streamlined workflow for you and your sales team that aligns with your business needs.
In order for accurate forecasting, Salesken’s sales forecasting software has to pull data from all data recording systems. The platform needs internal sales data, including call data, emails, chats, and more, to forecast and predict future growth. It enables seamless integration with other data systems you might use to record sales, including accounting applications and CRM, to collect and analyze data.
Not all sales calls end up in lead conversion. Salesken’s intelligence platform helps you determine which sales calls have the maximum impact on your leads and derive results. Our forecasting tool analyzes all your sales call and reps activities and tells you how you can increase the chance of converting leads into your customers.
Salesken has got you covered throughout the sales cycles—from qualifying leads to nurturing them for final conversion. Our sales intelligence data, when combined with AI-based suggestions, can help sales reps identify the contacts that are ready to buy. Thus, it reduces the average lead-to-close time and boosts the overall performance of your sales department.
Salesken’s AI-based forecasting tool helps sales decision-makers such as CFOs, CMOs, and other stakeholders involved by extracting specific insights from all customer/prospect interactions with utmost accuracy. Sales managers can use these insights to build better strategies and make business decisions that can lead to better engagement with prospects and improve their lead conversion ratio, resulting in increased revenue.
There are many possible risks involved in a sales pipeline—insufficient budgets, competitive pressure, unrealistic targets, etc. Sometimes salespeople are stuck in mundane tasks of data entry rather than picking up calls and following up with leads. With Salesken’s Sales forecasting software, you can track the current status of your sales goals and identify the gaps, if any. It also helps you identify any change in market demands so that you can adjust your sales planning accordingly and reach your goals.
Most of the time, prospects complain that the sales representatives do not realize their needs and try to push a solution that does not fit their requirements. Our sales forecasting tool analyzes all the past call recordings as well as present calls and reveals the areas or topics where leads are most responsive. With Salesken’s personalized sales strategies for every individual rep, identify leads' interests and steer the conversation towards those points in real time. Closing sales deals have never been this easier.
Using the insights from our sales forecast tools, salespeople can automatically identify which leads to prioritize. This helps save time by stopping them from chasing unqualified, low interest leads and increasing the chance of conversions. The platform helps you identify the accounts that are actively engaging and intend to purchase a product or service based on their behavior, interests, and the type of content they are consuming.
The best sales forecasting software helps managers track every individual's performance and identify opportunities to increase revenue.
To ensure maximum efficiency from a sales forecasting tool, it’s crucial to understand what impacts the forecast result. Here are a few common challenges that are typically faced during sales forecasting:
Sales forecasting requires a framework that needs to be revised from year to year. It involves three primary activities.
While running a sales forecast algorithm, you need to clearly define the estimated monetary amount and what the timeframes will be. Once you enter that data, the software pulls data from the same time period for the past years and starts running an analysis.
Sales forecasts can change at any given time due to unforeseen circumstances or events. Thus, it’s essential to review the estimates at key milestones, compare them with the current status, and revise if necessary.
While running a sales forecast analysis, take inputs from different team members. Ask different questions and take different angles of the data once in a while to find new and better ways to achieve a more accurate forecast.

A sales forecasting software solution is designed to help sales leaders and other decision-makers involved to predict the future growth of the company. It gathers and analyzes all past and present sales data, including call recordings, sales numbers, buyers' profiles, and others, to draw insights into revenue growth. Sales forecasting software is valuable for sizes and types of businesses. Some of the most popular sales forecasting solutions available in the market are Salesken, HubSpot Sales, and Pipedrive.
Sales forecasting software runs on a set of mathematical algorithms to predict the number of sales each product will have in a certain stipulated time period. It takes into account historical and present sales data to produce a forecast. Along with sales data, these algorithms also searched for market trends such as moving averages and seasonality. The sales forecast software then matches the algorithm with the trend of sales to each product and creates a sales forecast for the upcoming desired sales period. Based on this predictive analysis, sales forecasting software systems provide detailed reports on the sales estimates for the sales leaders to act upon.
You need to create a roadmap for choosing the right sales forecast software. Here’s how to do it. First, evaluate your business needs. Next, you dig deeper into the type of data you want to input into your system. This is essential because not every sales forecast platform is built for every kind of business. Second, you need to know how well the system integrates with other data systems, including your existing applications. Also, understand how easy it will be to migrate sales data from one system to another. Once you have all the information, you can look for sales forecast solutions with those features or talk to sales forecast software providers for a customized package for your business. Always consider how easy the software is to use and whether or not it falls into your budget category. You do not want to end up with software that will burn a hole in your pocket.
Having a sales forecast software like Salesken helps with accurate forecasting. Here are some of its benefits. An accurate sales forecast allows sales managers to efficiently allocate resources to increase revenue and manage their cash flow properly. Having reliable sales forecast software eliminates the guessing game and conveys confidence to the management and the board, as the predictions are based on data, not any gut feeling. Sales forecasting helps in strategic planning, which helps boost the overall performance of the sales department and makes it easy to achieve targets. Accurate forecasting sets benchmarks for future trends and allows sales leaders to structure and optimize their sales process to ensure more wins.

Choosing the right words is crucial in sales. And why words are so important can be summed up with this beautiful quote:
So, yes. The words your sales reps use when talking to prospects are extremely potent, as choosing the right ones can help them win more deals, while the wrong ones can hurt their chances of meeting the monthly quota.
1. Client’s name ‍
People are naturally attentive when you address them directly. Using the prospect’s name makes them feel that you are offering bespoke solutions. Research suggests that specific parts of our brain get activated when we hear our own name. Use the prospect’s name more often to close deals faster.
‍2. You ‍
The best sales pitch phrases put the customers and their needs at the center of the conversation. Using the word ‘you’ repeatedly helps maintain intimacy and keeps them engaged.
‍3. We ‍
Emphasizing the word ‘we’ can help break down barriers and enhance cooperation. It lets prospects know that you have a mutually beneficial relationship.
‍4. Imagine ‍
Power words for sales like ‘imagine’ can help you describe the benefits of your product/service while enabling prospects to visualize the bigger goals you can help them achieve. ‍
5. Thank you ‍
Whether during calls, in writing, or through actions, being polite sets you up for a friendlier relationship. ‍
6. Welcome ‍
Just as with ‘thank you', be generous in expressing your appreciation with ‘welcome’. Saying ‘you’re welcome’ is better than saying ‘no problem’.
7. Value ‍
Always find a way to contextualize your offerings according to the prospect’s needs. Personalization is key to doing business successfully in the new normal. According to a study, 80% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand that provides personalized experiences.
‍8. Advantage/Benefit ‍
‘Advantage’ and ‘benefit’ are sales buzzwords that reiterate your value proposition with clear reasoning as to why customers should opt for your offering over your competitor’s.
9. Help ‍
There is no better way to build trust than by helping customers beyond the purchasing process. Be sure to deliver if you are called upon. ‍
10. Do ‍
Experts suggest that using positive sales words such as ‘do’ instead of ‘try’ will make you seem more capable and reliable, and inspire confidence in your product/service. ‍
11. Amazing ‍
Customers don’t want to settle for something good; they want to be wowed! Use power words for sales such as ‘amazing’, ‘remarkable’, and ‘wonderful’ when you can deliver on the expectation.
12. Tips ‍
Additional information that can benefit customers will always get you brownie points. Use them wisely to add value without disclosing too much.
13. Avoid ‍
When used appropriately, your pitch could give a positive spin to sales words that are generally considered negative. This word can let them know that you are there to help them minimize wastage, whether it is cost, time, or effort. ‍
14. Proven ‍
Sales words such as ‘proven’, ‘genuine’, ‘authentic’, and ‘endorsed’ can help build trust. With increasing competition, customers want to partner with a brand they can rely on. When you use the word ‘proven’, it tells the customer that your product or service is market-tested and effective.  ‍
15. Safe ‍
It is important to inspire confidence and credibility with strong sales words such as ‘safe’ and ‘secure’ to let prospects know they are in good hands.
16. Because ‍
The conjunction allows you to bring customers’ focus to the reasoning or benefits for a particular offering, consciously connecting the two. And research suggests that people like to be given a reason or justification for things they are told.
17. Results ‍
Using definitive words like ‘results’, ‘guarantee’, or ‘authentic’ make customers feel comfortable investing in a product or service that seems likely to deliver on its promise. ‍
18. Or ‍
This can be a subtle way to make the prospect see your point of view or present them with alternatives, multiplying your chances of cracking a deal. ‍
19. Improved ‍
Products/services must adapt to changing customer preferences and needs. Using the word 'improved' can help you highlight how the new version of your products is better than ever before. ‍
20. I don’t know ‍
Sales phrases like this show prospects that you are honest and not afraid of admitting that you don’t know everything. Follow this up with “I will let you know soon” to show that you are willing to help the prospect further.
21. Fair
Humans have a natural desire to be perceived as fair and get what is fair. Make an offer or ask for something and follow it up with “Is that fair?”. When used 1.7x per deal, ‘Fair’ helps superstar sales reps move it forward to the next stage.
‍‍22. Remember ‍
'Remember' is a very useful word for reconnecting with past leads, reiterating the main features of your offerings, or reminding prospects of past promises (such as to close a deal sooner, maybe).
23. And ‍
Skillfully replace ‘but’ with ‘and’ when addressing a concern or criticism. ‘And’ when followed with the relevant information is one of the most useful sales transition phrases that bring inclusivity into your statements, even in scenarios where you may be disagreeing with the prospect.
‍24. Hurry Provide your prospects with a limited time offer they cannot resist. If they seem convinced, ask them to hurry so they don’t miss a good deal.
25. Free ‍
One of the most persuasive sales words, offering a part of the service or add-on benefit for ‘free’ can decrease the cost while increasing your offering’s perceived value.
26. Save ‍
Everyone wants to save on money, time, or resources. Back it up with a clear opportunity, and you could get a customer on board for the long-term.
27. Exclusive ‍
Sales buzzwords such as ‘exclusive’, ‘rare’, or ‘limited edition’ create the impression that your offering is unique and available only to a select few.
28. First ‍
This is another word that denotes exclusivity or brings in the wow factor. If you can deliver on the first-mover advantage, you can build a long-lasting relationship with customers.
29. Successful ‍
Top performers use ‘successful’ 4-6x per hour on a sales call. Follow their success mantra and close deals faster!
30. Simple/Easy ‍
From onboarding customers, using your product/service, and getting adequate support – if you can simplify the customer experience, they may be more willing to sign up with you.
31. Premium ‍
Sales words that denote luxury and prestige help grab attention. Customers respond to concepts of high esteem, value, and quality as it makes them feel privileged. ‍
32. Confidential ‍
Strong sales words such as ‘confidential’, ‘secret’, or ‘insider’ tap into natural human curiosity and serve to intrigue prospects. You can use these sales words to pique their interest and genuinely engage them. ‍
33. Risk-free This term acts as an assurance for customers to know that they are not going to lose anything, especially when they are signing up for a free demo or trial. Those were some of the most powerful words to sell a product.
34. We provide ‍
Prospects anticipate a sales pitch and stop listening the moment you say, ‘we provide’. Close rates fall by 22% when sales reps use it four or more times in a single call. ‍
35. Problem Hearing the word ‘problem’ immediately incites a negative reaction. When referring to an issue that the customer may face, use ‘challenge’ or ‘hurdle’ instead. ‍
36 Honestly Although a positive-sounding word, ‘honestly’ can have a negative connotation in a sales language. When overused, this word could make the prospect feel like everything else you have said before may not be true.
‍37. Hopefully/Maybe These words are vague and do not instill confidence. They indicate that you are unsure of what you are saying or promising. If you are not confident of your product/service’s benefits, why would prospects be?
‍38. Discount Don’t offer a 33% discount; instead, offer 50% more of the same product at the same price! Discounts devalue your products and can decrease your chances of closing a deal by 17%. ‍
39. Obviously ‘Obviously’ sounds condescending. It sounds like you are undermining the client’s intelligence by stating the obvious. ‍
40. Cheap Using ‘cheap’ undervalues your offering. It gives the feeling that your product or service is substandard. Say ‘cost-effective’ or ‘economical’ instead. ‍
41. Free Trial Substitute ‘free trial’ with ‘demo’ or ‘pilot’ if you are not looking to lower your chances of moving to the next stage by 5%. ‍
42. Competitor It is best not to bring up competitors unless the prospect does so. Putting down your competitors reflects poorly on you and your company. Instead, talk about how your offerings are at par with industry standards and how you can exceed their expectations. ‍
43. Quota Never mention that you are doing the job for incentives or fulfilling your quota. It can make prospects think you are only trying to close a deal even if it’s not a good fit for them. ‍
44. Objections When addressing queries from prospects, avoid categorizing them as objections. Call it a ‘concern’ or ‘challenge’ and show them that you are willing to address any issues. ‍
45. Prospects Do not refer to your prospects as ‘prospects’. You will immediately make them feel dehumanized and disconnected. ‍
46. Perfect Is it okay to reinforce how ‘perfect’ everything about your deal is? When used more than four times during a call, the advance rate drops by 16%. ‍
47. Pitch Even though you are technically pitching to your prospect, it is a very salesy term that implies you are there to sell a product instead of helping them find the right solutions. Say ‘presentation’ or ‘discussion’ instead. ‍
48. Cutting-edge/Innovative These are some of the most overused sales words, as every company tries to position itself as cutting-edge or innovative. ‍
49. Erm  Constantly making sounds such as ‘erm’, ‘ah’, or ‘uhh’ make prospects feel you have not come prepared. They also make you sound unprofessional and unsure. ‍
50. Don’t  ‘Don’t’ is negative. No one likes to hear what they should not do. Instead, tell them what they should do. ‍
51. But When you make a positive statement, using ‘but’ means you are contradicting what you said previously. This creates dissonance in the prospect’s mind. ‍
52. Show you how Spend more time on ‘why’ rather than ‘how’ something works. If you use such sales phrases more than four times in a call, your close rate may drop by 13%.
Salesken is a tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to identify meaning and emotion reflected by words that are spoken during sales calls.

Closing sales is the ‘make or break’ step that means time lost or revenue earned. There are several reasons why a deal doesn’t close. To start with, 1/3rd of salespeople feel closing sales is the single most challenging part of their job, reflecting a lack of preparedness or confidence.
This technique, popularized by Tim Ferriss in his book ‘’The Four-Hour Workweek’’, is inspired by pet store owners who offer people to take a pup home for the weekend before they commit to adopting.
This technique works on prospects who struggle to realize the value of your offering against the price. It’s a low-pressure tactic where you give the prospect an impressive product pitch and then a trial period to test out the product/service.
You could also provide them with one-on-one or 1: many demos where they can ask questions, and you can answer them on the spot. If they like your product, you won’t have to do anything else to get them to buy.
For example:
“How about a 7-day free trial to see if our product is the right fit for your company?”
“I can arrange for a free online session on Machine Learning so you can take a call on this upskilling course.”
The Puppy Dog Close is useful when you are confident that they will see your product’s value within the trial period. If your product is complex with a long onboarding process, then you’d have to either extend the duration of the trial offer or skip this sales closing tip altogether.
An assumptive close operates on the assumption your prospect is already prepared to buy and moves backward to make sure nothing is left unattended. Use this technique only when your prospect has checked all the boxes on your qualification list and you are sure your offering adds value to their business.‍
For example:
“So, can we schedule a meeting for implementation next Wednesday?”
“Great, so you agree it’ll be a good addition. Shall I share the contract copy by email?”‍
A word of caution: The last thing you’d want is your prospect's buying time when all the benefits have been explained and understood by them. ‍
Build trust and demonstrate value first, then come out with the ask at the end of the need discovery journey. If they’ve shown interest in what you have to say, you could question them if they start to show signs of losing it.
This technique plays on the human tendency of wanting what we can’t have. It works best in situations when a prospect throws up objections, particularly regarding price.
Here, taking something away from the deal will either make it more suitable for their needs or make them see the benefits they could lose out on. It is easier for them to choose an offer that works for them rather than contemplating purchase altogether.
For example:
“We could get you started on a smaller plan instead. You’ll still get the basic features. However, most of our clients are on the [original] plan as it includes [additional features]. What do you make of it?”
Pro Tip: Take Away Close works well when your product is customizable to meet user demands, like insurance plans, staff training, premium subscriptions, etc. If it isn’t, then you may have to withdraw from the deal.
As the name suggests, this closing technique involves persuading prospects to take a decision as soon as possible by creating a sense of urgency in them with a limited offer or special deal.
For example:
“You get 5% off the original plan if you place the order now. This offer vanishes at 8 PM tonight.”
“If you register today, you’d even have free access to our exclusive loyalty program. Prices rise from tomorrow.”
This technique works well when the prospect is happy with the product but is taking time to decide. If this is because they aren’t confident enough to convince the true decision-makers, driving a cost-benefit may work.
But if they are not confident of all the benefits yet, using this technique would make it seem like your product is not that valuable, instead of instilling the fear of missing out on a good price.
To successfully close a sale, you must ask a series of questions and answer some the customer may have. This technique helps handle objections better and naturally moves the prospect towards purchase. When there is nothing else left to discuss, get them to finalize the deal.
Ask sales closing questions like
“Does what I’m offering address all your concern? Then I can take you through the buying process.”
“If you don’t have any other questions, can we proceed to the formalities?”
Questions help, especially for products/services that are slightly complex, like software or financial schemes. Ensure the questions help prospects realize the value of your offering and how it can solve their problems. It is easier to address them while on the call than trying to change their mind after they say no (which would mean you were wasting time in the first place).
Sometimes a rep seems to be doing everything right. They speak well; they do their research; they end their sales calls with a high sentiment score. But somehow, they still don’t close deals. Delving deeper into sales calls analytics may be able to reveal why that is.
One of the key benefits of using a conversational intelligence platform like Salesken is that you can identify the exact behaviors/actions that close more deals – the tactics that your best performing reps employ, so you can replicate that with the rest of your team.
Salesken detects meaning and emotion in speech and helps your reps respond better to prospects with real-time cues displayed on the Help Zone. With Salesken, you can better equip your sales reps to decide which closing technique works best and update your playbook as well.

Closing sales is the ‘make or break’ step that means time lost or revenue earned. There are several reasons why a deal doesn’t close. To start with, 1/3rd of salespeople feel closing sales is the single most challenging part of their job, reflecting a lack of preparedness or confidence.
This technique, popularized by Tim Ferriss in his book ‘’The Four-Hour Workweek’’, is inspired by pet store owners who offer people to take a pup home for the weekend before they commit to adopting.
This technique works on prospects who struggle to realize the value of your offering against the price. It’s a low-pressure tactic where you give the prospect an impressive product pitch and then a trial period to test out the product/service.
You could also provide them with one-on-one or 1: many demos where they can ask questions, and you can answer them on the spot. If they like your product, you won’t have to do anything else to get them to buy.
For example:
“How about a 7-day free trial to see if our product is the right fit for your company?”
“I can arrange for a free online session on Machine Learning so you can take a call on this upskilling course.”
The Puppy Dog Close is useful when you are confident that they will see your product’s value within the trial period. If your product is complex with a long onboarding process, then you’d have to either extend the duration of the trial offer or skip this sales closing tip altogether.
An assumptive close operates on the assumption your prospect is already prepared to buy and moves backward to make sure nothing is left unattended. Use this technique only when your prospect has checked all the boxes on your qualification list and you are sure your offering adds value to their business.‍
For example:
“So, can we schedule a meeting for implementation next Wednesday?”
“Great, so you agree it’ll be a good addition. Shall I share the contract copy by email?”‍
A word of caution: The last thing you’d want is your prospect's buying time when all the benefits have been explained and understood by them. ‍
Build trust and demonstrate value first, then come out with the ask at the end of the need discovery journey. If they’ve shown interest in what you have to say, you could question them if they start to show signs of losing it.
This technique plays on the human tendency of wanting what we can’t have. It works best in situations when a prospect throws up objections, particularly regarding price.
Here, taking something away from the deal will either make it more suitable for their needs or make them see the benefits they could lose out on. It is easier for them to choose an offer that works for them rather than contemplating purchase altogether.
For example:
“We could get you started on a smaller plan instead. You’ll still get the basic features. However, most of our clients are on the [original] plan as it includes [additional features]. What do you make of it?”
Pro Tip: Take Away Close works well when your product is customizable to meet user demands, like insurance plans, staff training, premium subscriptions, etc. If it isn’t, then you may have to withdraw from the deal.
As the name suggests, this closing technique involves persuading prospects to take a decision as soon as possible by creating a sense of urgency in them with a limited offer or special deal.
For example:
“You get 5% off the original plan if you place the order now. This offer vanishes at 8 PM tonight.”
“If you register today, you’d even have free access to our exclusive loyalty program. Prices rise from tomorrow.”
This technique works well when the prospect is happy with the product but is taking time to decide. If this is because they aren’t confident enough to convince the true decision-makers, driving a cost-benefit may work.
But if they are not confident of all the benefits yet, using this technique would make it seem like your product is not that valuable, instead of instilling the fear of missing out on a good price.
To successfully close a sale, you must ask a series of questions and answer some the customer may have. This technique helps handle objections better and naturally moves the prospect towards purchase. When there is nothing else left to discuss, get them to finalize the deal.
Ask sales closing questions like
“Does what I’m offering address all your concern? Then I can take you through the buying process.”
“If you don’t have any other questions, can we proceed to the formalities?”
Questions help, especially for products/services that are slightly complex, like software or financial schemes. Ensure the questions help prospects realize the value of your offering and how it can solve their problems. It is easier to address them while on the call than trying to change their mind after they say no (which would mean you were wasting time in the first place).
Sometimes a rep seems to be doing everything right. They speak well; they do their research; they end their sales calls with a high sentiment score. But somehow, they still don’t close deals. Delving deeper into sales calls analytics may be able to reveal why that is.
One of the key benefits of using a conversational intelligence platform like Salesken is that you can identify the exact behaviors/actions that close more deals – the tactics that your best performing reps employ, so you can replicate that with the rest of your team.
Salesken detects meaning and emotion in speech and helps your reps respond better to prospects with real-time cues displayed on the Help Zone. With Salesken, you can better equip your sales reps to decide which closing technique works best and update your playbook as well.

Sales demos are critical to a customer’s decision to purchase. No matter how high the purchase intent or how tedious the search process is, customers seldom make purchase decisions, especially for important and high-priced items, without getting a demo. Demos help clarify and confirm whether the product really meets one’s requirements. Hence, in any business, the concept of a demo is highly relevant.
There are two types of demos:
A well-planned, strategic sales demo can quickly convert more leads into customers. This blog will offer some key insights into the tried and tested strategies to help you plan a great sales demo. So, let’s get started!
Nobody wants to listen to a sales demo that’s all over the place. Here are some tips for structuring your sales demo:
Record yourself whenever you’re delivering a demo; later, you can use sales enablement tools like SalesKen to analyze the improvement areas in that demo. Here’s how SalesKen can help you deliver better demos:
Remember that a sales enablement tool can develop a data-driven approach and direct your sales team accordingly. With proper utilization of such a tool, there’ll be no room left for conjecture.‍
Want to ace your sales demos? Focus more on the takeaways and not the features. Your product can be feature-rich.
But what ultimately matters is that how it will benefit the prospect and make their life simpler. So, highlighting the outcomes is always a better idea. Help the prospect envision how the product will simplify their problems.
Here is an example to break this down. Suppose you’re representing a web development company. During the sales demo, you’re trying to convince the prospect by saying that “We’ll transform your website.”
But why should the prospect believe you?
What are the changes you’ll bring in to transform their website? Instead, try to prove your point. For instance, show them what changes you’re referring to and how the new website will be more beneficial for the prospects.
Sales reps often freak out when there are awkward silences in a demo. But silences are pretty normal. Silence doesn’t always mean that the prospect is not convinced with your software demo. It can mean that they’re processing their thoughts. It’s worth noting, however, that sales reps are often very enthusiastic about the products, and they keep talking about the product without realizing that the prospect might be feeling left out.
So, it is ideal that after every few minutes, or after sharing a section of your pitch, you encourage the prospect to share their thoughts or ask questions, especially if they’re silent. Make the demo session interactive whenever possible.
Silence is easy if you know how to deal with it.
There should be a segment in every sales demo that’s purely dedicated to Q&A. Acing this Q&A session is very important to win a sales deal. In fact, it’s not mandatory that the prospect has to ask questions every time.
You can start asking the questions too. That’s way better than turning the demo session into a lecture.
Remember, the questions you ask should be open-ended. That’s when the prospect will be able to answer freely.
Here’re some questions you can use:
Research the prospect to make your questions stand out.
There is no harm in rehearsing your sales demo again and again. If you’re a newbie, practice will help you get familiar with the process of demos. If you develop a data-driven strategy, the process of rehearsing will become much simpler for you.
How about taking help from sales enablement software?
SalesKen’s software can analyze your past demo calls in real-time. It can identify the real-time talking points with the help of advanced analytics and help your reps find smarter strategies to ace the demo calls. Hence, when a rep rehearses for the demo, they’ll be able to perfect it easily if they can consider these tips.
Treat the sales demo as your customers’ story where they are the main character and your product plays a supporting role. Suppose you’re planning a project management software demo.
Here are two possible approaches that you can adopt:
In the first scenario, the product is the main character, in the second scenario, the customer is the main character. Ideally, you need to support the basic first pitch with the second, storytelling-focused pitch.
If the prospect is showing interest in your product by the end of the sales demo, you can always book another meeting with them for pricing discussions. Sometimes prospects show interest, but they demand more knowledge on the product. That is again a positive sign. In that case, you can schedule another product demo with the same prospect.
A clear understanding of steps is crucial to the prospect closing the deal. Make sure that you clearly explain details like who will be in touch and when, whom to communicate with for further queries, if they need to take any further steps, etc.
Don’t keep the prospects on hold. Make sure that they know about all the communication touchpoints. Else, you risk losing a high-value sales deal.
A sales demo has the power to make or break any potential deal. So, make sure that sales reps are taking extra care to master them. Sales managers should guide the reps to deliver a flawless sales demo. We hope these tips to ace demos will help you out. Don’t lose hope if the first few demo sessions don’t work out. They’ll qualify eventually. Just keep trying and get better with every demo.
As mentioned earlier, SalesKen can help you close deals faster than ever before. Book a demo today!

As former FBI hostage negotiator and businessman, Chris Voss said, “Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much as possible.”
The same can be said for a sales conversation between your rep and a prospect. Your sales rep’s primary aim is to uncover a need that your product/service can fulfill. Asking the right questions is the only way to uncover these needs.
Open-ended questions do not prompt a specific answer - yes or no. Instead, such questions are asked during sales calls to elicit a more detailed response from prospects about their pain points or needs by using the right words. Open-ended questions enable the free exchange of ideas and help reps build rapport.
“What is your sales target for this year?” vs “How do you propose to achieve your sales target this year?”
Let’s see how open-ended questions can transform sales calls from sounding like interrogations to explorations that get more leads to do business with you.
Open-ended questions lead to open-minded conversations:
You could enrich your entire sales cycle by including open-ended queries at various stages.
Sales Stages:-
Building rapport with prospects yields 80% more lead acquisition. And asking open-ended questions about topical or industry-related trends can get prospects to open up to you.
For instance, don’t just ask if the pandemic has affected their business. Replace that question with “The pandemic would have certainly affected your topline. How else has it affected your business?”
You can build a strong connect with potential customers by showing concern and getting prospects to talk about their business.
Just 13% of sales reps understand customer needs. In GK Chesterton’s words, “It’s not that they can’t see the solution; it’s that they can’t see the problem.” Ask open-ended questions to help prospects discover what exactly is holding them back from achieving their goals.
Need discovery can be passive or participative in nature. With a passive query, you can engage leads without being a party to it. For example, “Why do you think your team is unable to reach revenue thresholds?”
On the other hand, participative queries include your role in the situation. For example, “How do you think a marketing tool like ours can help you surpass your revenue thresholds?”
Good need discovery can empower you to design powerful needs statements, based on which you can present a full-stack sales pitch.
Here’s how Robert Pearlstein, President, Qanopy, helped a large media company migrate its revenues to digital assets by articulating an excellent needs statement by simply breaking it down.
Problem – Need a way to deliver a digital user experience
Population – New media properties
Outcome – Offer personalized content, enhance engagement, and drive subscription revenue
Do you want prospects to realize your products/services' value without making them feel like you are blowing your own horn? Then ask carefully crafted open-ended questions that can become the building blocks of self-discovery.
This way, you can get prospects to build a clear vision of how your solution solves their problems and where it can take their business in the future. For example, ask, “How do you think integrating our platform with your IT architecture will improve your company’s bottom line?”
Did you know your sales team’s talk ratio can impact their close rates?
When you handle objections well, your success rate rises by 64%.
‍Whether it’s about pricing, performance promise, or customer care, you can allay customer apprehensions with open-ended questions.
Besides enriching your learning journey, probing open-ended questions can help you demonstrate your seriosness to solve customer problems.
For example, ask “What are some problems you wish [competitor product] could solve?” or “Why do you think it doesn’t make sense for you to pay a little more for a product that provides many more features than [economical alternative of your offering]?”
It’s the moment of reckoning! Open-ended questions at this stage will not only give you a hint of what’s in your prospect’s mind but also allow you to demonstrate the sincerity of purpose. It will reflect your earnest desire to help them overcome any final concerns.
Don’t ask, “Can we close the deal today?” or “When can I call you again to know your decision?” Instead, ask, “Is there anything else I can do to help you reach a decision?” or “Is there anything else I can do to help you get approval from your CEO?”
92% of all customer interactions still occur over the phone. Salesken can assist your reps at every step of the sales journey by analyzing calls in real-time. Basically, Salesken detects meaning as well as emotions from speech. It then uses these signals to instantly display relevant talking points (curated from your customer databases and the Internet) on the rep’s screen.
With all this information in front of them, reps can craft targeted and open-ended questions that elicit valuable information from your prospects. Moreover, having a better understanding of customer sentiments can help reps correctly identify customer intent.
What’s more, Salesken’s post-call analytics can help sales leaders improve their team’s overall performance. Salesken allows you to compare talk ratios, indicating how much your reps are engaging prospects by asking more open-ended questions.

As former FBI hostage negotiator and businessman, Chris Voss said, “Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much as possible.”
The same can be said for a sales conversation between your rep and a prospect. Your sales rep’s primary aim is to uncover a need that your product/service can fulfill. Asking the right questions is the only way to uncover these needs.
Open-ended questions do not prompt a specific answer - yes or no. Instead, such questions are asked during sales calls to elicit a more detailed response from prospects about their pain points or needs by using the right words. Open-ended questions enable the free exchange of ideas and help reps build rapport.
“What is your sales target for this year?” vs “How do you propose to achieve your sales target this year?”
Let’s see how open-ended questions can transform sales calls from sounding like interrogations to explorations that get more leads to do business with you.
Open-ended questions lead to open-minded conversations:
You could enrich your entire sales cycle by including open-ended queries at various stages.
Sales Stages:-
Building rapport with prospects yields 80% more lead acquisition. And asking open-ended questions about topical or industry-related trends can get prospects to open up to you.
For instance, don’t just ask if the pandemic has affected their business. Replace that question with “The pandemic would have certainly affected your topline. How else has it affected your business?”

Conversation data captured during sales calls is a rapidly growing pool of exchanges between the agent and the customer. There is tremendous scope for extracting intelligence and reusing it, after some curing, to reinforce the diverse conversation scenarios. With the incremental insights that the system harnesses from conversations, a sales agent today is able to cross the inflection point set by the age of big-data in a field which has been long driven by empirical methods, tips and guidelines. The system is incremental in nature due to its capability to learn from successful sales call instances and applying this to identify and guide scenarios where it can lead the conversation to successful closure. In all, a sales agent with the set of tools offered by the conversation intelligence system is well equipped to deliver a better, streamlined, well-informed and lucid sales experience, and is able to perform intricate post-call analysis.
The Signal Generation and Conversation State Tracking system is a post-call analysis tool designed to extract intelligence from sales conversations. Typically a successful sales call follows a loosely designed roadmap contingent on several factors like consumer profile, agent profile, products and features profile and so forth. It also has an underlying order in which it progresses. Given below is an excerpt from a sales call.
Agent : Hello my name is Andy, am I speaking with Shubham.
Customer : Yes it’s Shubham here, how can I help you Andy
Agent : I am calling from xyz company and I wanted to take a few minutes of your time to talk about a product you showed interest in recently.
Customer : Yes, I would like to know more about abc product.
Agent : abc product is our flagship product and it offers one-stop retail solutions from strategizing and R&D to execution. You can expect [...]
Customer : [...]
Agent : [...]
Customer : Sounds good, however I’d like some refactoring in some aspects of the R&D solution. [...]
Agent : [...]
Customer : [...]
The utterances have been divided into sections ascertained by their dimensions such as Introduction, Product Feature, Solutioning etc. The sequence in which these dimensions occur during a call are a blend of some pre-established criteria, for instance a call would conventionally begin with introductions, end with scheduling follow-ups etc.; and with agent-customer interaction driven criterion. In the above excerpt, the consumer mentions his/her need to understand about abc product and thus, the conversation progresses into the Product Feature subspace.
Fig. 1 : Example of traversing conversation states in a typical sales conversation
A conversation subspace is a set of utterances that address a specific agenda during the conversation, like an itinerary of sorts. It is signified with the help of signals and dimensions. Signals are generic intents that encompass utterance groups. Dimensions are broad sets of coarse-grained agent-customer conversation intents that fulfil a major criterion of a sales call such as Introduction, Lead Qualification, Solutioning etc. Identifying and learning to model the sequence of subspaces (or dimensions and signals) that a conversation proceeds in, can set a guideline to streamline a sales call. This conversation modelling can be used to ingest successful sales calls from agents (and unsuccessful ones) to analyze the factors that lead-up to a successful conversion.
We have seen the sequencing of conversation subspaces, we can now consider a fine-grain view of the content of subspaces. Conversation states are temporal entities, in that, modelling them entails learning from time-stamped or ordered conversation structures to output win-sequences of conversation entities. The content of the conversation subspaces is a spatial problem which depends on factors such as customer profile, product profile, agent profile. This is done by applying a pipeline of cascaded natural language understanding(NLU) models to gain semantic understanding from sales conversations.
Fig. 2 : Salesken’s conversation flow tool tracks the agent-customer conversations and highlights the intents caught(in the form of dimensions) at various parts of the discussion.
For instance the Pricing subspace for a product of a telecommunications company would encompass a different set of guidelines than that of, say an educational-tool company.
Here product profiling would help emphasize what to address given the context.
Identifying consumer behavior can be an important aid in a sales call. This can be learnt from the past conversations with the particular customer. Lead qualification for an educational-tool company would require a pitch to be closer to the needs of children and tutoring more efficiently, as against that for a bank where the agenda would be closer to highlighting loan-schemes to customers in a more attractive manner.
Certain agents may have a better success rate with some consumer sectors as compared to others. Ascertaining agent-win sectors and using this intelligence to assign agents to focus on their strong-suit sectors can offer great increment in the overall success-rate of sales call conversions.
Fig. 3 : Profiling entities across product, customer and agent for conversation intelligence.
As we have seen, a streamlined sales conversation can be loosely mapped to a dimension state space with an underlying order of precedence of the dimension states. Signal entities defined for an organization map back to dimensions(which are cross vertical entities) and can help identify the transition changes that occur in a sales call. Dimension state transitions and the organization specific signals they encompass are defined in a playbook which serves as a guide to a streamlined agent-to-customer interaction.
There are two major tasks in abstracting the underlying state transitions in a sales conversation, namely signal discovery and their mapping to the dimensions set, and transitions between dimensions. At a high level the playbook dimensions are defined as the following,
Our systems are designed to handle the signal discovery and state transition task in tandem. The model learns from the underlying patterns of successful sales conversations(calls that the agent has closed successfully) to identify the dimension state at a point during the call. This can assist tasks like cueing wherein knowledge of the dimension state in the conversation can enrich the response generation mechanism.
Typically the objective of such a model is set up so as to learn from successful conversations the cumulative probability of transitions between states which lead to a successful closure. Once the semantics of the utterances are matched to signals (given the context of the utterances in the previous turns), these signals are classified among the dimension states. The encoded context helps identify the nature of the signal at any part of the conversation, for instance a signal(or similar signals) could appear at different parts of the conversation and would therefore belong to different dimensions.
For a state transition model to work, we need to have discovered an all-encompassing set of signals. Signals are a bridge between utterances and dimension states. In terms of natural language understanding the abstraction from utterances to signals and their mapping to dimension states follows the fine-grained to coarse-grained paradigm. Signal discovery module uses a hybrid of supervised and semi-supervised approaches over the entire utterance space.
Broadly speaking, these are the major items in the signal discovery pipeline :
Given below is a visual representation of a few cluster entities. The system establishes priority among the utterances in the cluster and ranks them. The clusters are also themselves ranked on the basis of homogeneity and diversity.
Fig. 4 : Conversation subspace clustered on the basis of utterance semantics.
The visual representation tool can be used to assist in the post-call analytic tasks. For instance, it is possible to inspect the cluster space and cherry-pick signals or define new signals and seed the cluster space with these new signals to see how the utterance space converges around them. Based on whether the seeded signal is defined from the cluster groups or introduced through some other criterion, this becomes a self-supervised task for the system to identify utterances that would be entailed in this signal group and rank them.

In terms of natural language understanding the abstraction from utterances to signals and their mapping to dimension states follows the fine-grained to coarse-grained paradigm. Signal discovery module uses a hybrid of supervised and semi-supervised approaches over the entire utterance space.
Broadly speaking, these are the major items in the signal discovery pipeline :
Given below is a visual representation of a few cluster entities. The system establishes priority among the utterances in the cluster and ranks them. The clusters are also themselves ranked on the basis of homogeneity and diversity.
Fig. 4 : Conversation subspace clustered on the basis of utterance semantics.
The visual representation tool can be used to assist in the post-call analytic tasks. For instance, it is possible to inspect the cluster space and cherry-pick signals or define new signals and seed the cluster space with these new signals to see how the utterance space converges around them. Based on whether the seeded signal is defined from the cluster groups or introduced through some other criterion, this becomes a self-supervised task for the system to identify utterances that would be entailed in this signal group and rank them.

As a sales representative, you would know how hard it is to get a prospect to pick up the call, let alone close the deal. In fact, 61% of salespeople consider it more challenging than it was just five years ago due to the dynamic sales landscape and changing customer expectations.
Even when your prospect answers your call, they can be hesitant or unwilling to take the conversation further.
Quite often, sales reps face such incidents – which are called ‘sales objections ‘– and end up getting anxious while handling them.
These common sales objections can seem like a dead-end and tend to give reps sleepless nights. The reps start speaking faster to counter the prospect, and some even interrupt the customer multiple times, which can hamper closing the deal.
Before we explore how to manage and overcome these objections, let's understand them first.
A sales objection could be a question, action, or a negative statement given in response to your pitch. And when a customer repeatedly oscillates from showing interest to showing none, it can be challenging to navigate to your end goal. It's important to recognize why your lead could be putting forth these objections.
Prospects can be difficult to convince or hesitant to buy your product for a plethora of reasons. Customer objections can be mostly summarized with the acronym 'BANT', which stands for:
We can include many top sales objections here. But before we get into that, let's break down these points first.
Did you know that 35% of sales objections are due to pricing issues? Prospects can hesitate to consider your offering due to the financial risks involved. Here, sales reps need to prove what benefits your product will bring to the prospects so that they can justify the risks with the value of your solution.
If your prospect is not the ultimate decision-maker, it can seem challenging for them to convince their boss or supervisor.
Ask to arrange a call with their boss, and don't skimp on the details when on call. If things go well, the prospect might also be able to put in a good word about you to their boss.
Perceive objection as an opportunity to identify and solve customer problems. Sales objections that revolve around a lack of need are a perfect way to get information from your prospect regarding their current issues and inform them of the value your solution provides. Asking open-ended questions also aids in the process of qualifying your lead. Asking questions such as, “What are your top business priorities?” can prompt the prospect into the conversation. Also, it will give you the needed information to offer value and address their needs.
Often, the issue isn't exactly timing – it is the lack of urgency. An overwhelming number of sales reps have trouble establishing urgency. There is a need to convince them of the need to solve the problems as soon as possible because they will consider your solutions more seriously. Sometimes prospects brush off your calls by claiming the issue as ‘timing’. When asked to elaborate, they give random responses or excuses instead of valid reasons. It isn't easy to establish urgency under such circumstances, and it's better to schedule a call for another time.
Before getting into handling the objections, sales reps need to understand how to keep customers engaged and add value to the conversation.
These are some of the top ways to create a positive sales experience, according to buyers:
A sales representative that goes on the defensive by engaging in a monologue will not close a deal any time soon. There are multiple ways of fulfilling the buyer's expectations.
First, ask questions.
Before jumping in with a response to the customer objections, you need to get a few more details from the prospects. By doing this, you can avoid a conversation based on assumptions or misunderstandings.
Questions also give you ready access to critical information the prospect may have left out. Their response would give you a better understanding of the prospect and the current challenges they face, and their specific needs.
Then, act tactfully
Prospects will start avoiding you if you try to sell and don't offer any value. Connect with your prospects and handle their objections tactfully by following the effective selling technique, LAER Bonding Process.
Listening to your prospects needs is essential, so you must show interest and respect. You can encourage them to talk about the issues they are facing without hesitation. You need to be patient and avoid interrupting your prospect, as that can create a wrong impression.
Listening and acknowledging may co-occur. In fact, acknowledging your prospect as they speak can affirm that you are actively listening to them.
While acknowledging what your prospect is saying, you can mirror what they are saying to demonstrate understanding and ask for clarifications. This step is specifically created to confirm what exactly your prospect is talking about and to collect any more information if required.
To respond to what your prospect has told you, you need to have a near-perfect understanding of their concern and circumstances. This step would be where you delve into problem-solving and talk about the next steps.
Here are some examples of the most common objections you might face with a prospect and how to resolve them.
You might have to clarify what issues the customer is currently facing. Then you can make them understand why solving them should be a priority and how your product or service help them.
Example response: “Could you tell me a bit more about your current priorities? What issues are you facing at the moment?”
‍You don't have to justify your product's price here. Instead, focus more on the value your product brings to your prospect and how it specifically addresses the issues they are facing.
Example response: “I'd love to elaborate on our product's features because I can see that it can resolve the issues you mentioned earlier.”
The first step would be to tell them about your product's USP. If possible, you can refer to any consumer studies your organization has done to use as a response.
Example response: “We have a proven track record. Here's a statistic that shows how many consumers are satisfied with our product compared to our competition. Would you like to discuss the features of our product that could assist you?”
If your customer feels they cannot justify this purchase to their team or supervisor, you can take the reins from there and ask them to connect you with the decision-maker.
Example response: “Could you please get me in touch with the person who is authorized to make these decisions?”
This concern is valid for any team. You can offer demos for the primary users and guide them with features and benefits. You can also let them know that the customer success team is available to assist them.
Example response: “I can see that your concern is regarding your understanding of our product, so I'd like to know which aspects of it are confusing to you. If you'd like, I can put you in touch with a product engineer from our team to assist you with this issue.”
Talk about services that can be supplementary and can aid in adding this feature. For instance, if you are selling software, make sure you inform your prospect about its integrations with other applications.
Example response: “We have an integration with a partner's product that works well with our product and can provide the feature you are looking for.”
You would need to establish value here. You might have to formally pitch to your prospect regarding what they seek from a solution and what benefits your product/service brings to the table.
Example response: “I would love to schedule a call to explain the ROI you could gain with our product/service and the benefits it can bring to your organization.”
Differentiating yourself from the competitor is crucial. In this case, you'll have to dig deeper into what doesn't work for the competitor and explain how you can do it right. Why is the competitor's product "just fine"?
Example response: “We would like to understand what specific features you like about our competitor's product. What issues do you face with it? Here's how our product can do more.”
Offer to call the prospect back later, but remember to verify when they would be free to schedule a call. This would create a sense of responsibility for answering a call at a specific time, and it can make your potential customers feel like they have already invested energy into your product.
Example response: “I understand. Please let me know what time you would be free for a call."
Sometimes prospects can get aggressive, and the key here would be to keep calm and respond humbly. Get directly to the point and convey how you got their information. Also, ensure that you are ethically sourcing information.
Example response: “We got your details from Mr XYZ from ABC company." or “You submitted an online form on our website.”
Sales objections can be an excellent way to identify your prospect's needs, as well as help you in clearing any doubts surrounding your product, service, and organization. Sales reps need to engage meaningfully to overcome these issues confidently.
Conversational Intelligence platforms like Salesken can help sales reps in addressing objections.
The platform provides real-time cues for introduction, asking questions, giving responses, and more during their interactions. It analyzes speech to detect meaning and emotions that can assist your reps in understanding the prospect better.
Sales leaders also get post-call analytics, which can help them get references from successful call instances of the best performers and give suggestions for the overall team improvement. This, in tandem with lead-scoring insights, can ensure a closed deal with the right prospect.

Sales Insight


table of content
In a recent review with one of our clients, we made a startling discovery. Our client is an EdTech company that creates virtual learning programs for children in school and sells them to parents.
Upon studying sales data for the last quarter, an interesting trend showed up. Our client’s sales reps seemed to be spending almost 20% of their conversational time fielding questions about their competitors. In contrast, only 15% was spent talking about the product and its USPs.
This discovery made our client completely reevaluate their sales playbook and update their pitch to make it easier for their reps to close leads. But this isn’t the only insight we’ve garnered into how to pitch a product in the past two years of analyzing more than 1 million minutes of sales calls every month.
You know the basic stuff:
To avoid the awkward interruptions of “Yeah, I already know that” or risk your customer losing interest, ask how familiar your customer already is with your product and brand. For instance, if they aren’t familiar with your product and haven’t even used your competitors’, you can start from the beginning. But if they are, you can steer the conversation towards your product’s USPs and differentiators.
Knowing the limitations of your product helps you give customers a realistic picture of what it can and can’t do. But most products are in a constant state of Work in Progress because innovation is a constant process
If your product team is open to customer feedback and always searching for ways to enhance what’s on offer, that’s a strength, not a weakness. Your product team may be rolling out new features and beta releases as you speak, but this is a sign of progress and improvement and that’s how your customers need to see it as well.
Your product may be great and have a ton of features. But what your customer needs to know is how it’s going to solve their specific problem. That’s why need discovery is so important. You get the opportunity to uncover what your customer wishes they could do better or faster or more efficiently, so you can highlight the features of your product that empower them to do that. Pro tip: Ask your product team for some proof points for the ultimate benefit trifecta- time, money and effort. Having numbers for the exact value your product can offer in these 3 buckets can fast track closure.
Let’s say you are selling cloud storage data that streamlines the digital assets of multiple teams. Your customer raises a concern that all teams having access may compromise the security of sensitive data. And just like that, what you have always positioned as a benefit suddenly becomes a barrier. Unless, that is, you were ready with an answer. Then it serves to strengthen your pitch.
In this way, every feature of your product can lead to a follow up question. A good pitch prepares for this. And in case you’re worried by this because more objections mean a weaker pitch, think again.
The sales tech stack is constantly being upgraded, because there’s a direct bottom line benefit that comes from investing in technology
Whether or not your product is a replacement for one they’re already using, it may invite resistance because of the sheer amount of effort and training it takes to implement a new product and get the entire team familiarized with using it.
It can thus be helpful to highlight the time and effort your product takes to integrate into your customer’s existing processes and databases, so they can start making the case internally.
Are you on call with the person who’s going to use your product? Or their manager? Or a member of the team they manage? Knowing how your product is going to impact the day-to-day of the person you’re talking to can help make a better case. You can talk to them in terms of the direct benefits they are going to experience rather than having them imagine an indirect outcome.
Putting your customer’s needs first doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring out everything your product can do or take them through the standard product demo. But the hook can be the core issue they are looking to solve.
Importantly – that doesn’t necessarily need to be your USP. You may realize that what matters to them most is different than you have always assumed is your greatest strength or differentiator, and that’s where customizing your pitch can help.
Pro tip: One of the best ways to customize your pitch is to have use cases specifically for the industry or company size of your customer’s enterprise. And finally, don’t give away too much
Remember: information is power. In your attempt to retain your customer’s attention, don’t offer so much advice and insights that the customer feels they’ve got everything they possibly could from you or your product. Leaving something to the imagination allows your customer to give you the benefit of the doubt in the hope that future calls will give them further help.
Plus, it helps to remember that you aren’t the product expert, and it’s best to be candid about that. It’s not your job to know the intricacies of your product. That’s what product demos and free trials are for.
You may have a product pitch that’s near perfect, but there is no guarantee you will be able to follow it as planned. Salesken doesn’t just assist your sales reps in conversation and make the leap from good to great. Salesken can even help your reps in situations where customers derail a conversation or pose questions they are not prepared to answer. It’s AI that makes your reps better at their jobs with real-time cues and prompts that mimic the tactics used by top-performers, so you can build a team of all stars.
So, what are you waiting for? Make the leap.

Sales Insight


table of content
In a recent review with one of our clients, we made a startling discovery. Our client is an EdTech company that creates virtual learning programs for children in school and sells them to parents.
Upon studying sales data for the last quarter, an interesting trend showed up. Our client’s sales reps seemed to be spending almost 20% of their conversational time fielding questions about their competitors. In contrast, only 15% was spent talking about the product and its USPs.
This discovery made our client completely reevaluate their sales playbook and update their pitch to make it easier for their reps to close leads. But this isn’t the only insight we’ve garnered into how to pitch a product in the past two years of analyzing more than 1 million minutes of sales calls every month.
You know the basic stuff:
To avoid the awkward interruptions of “Yeah, I already know that” or risk your customer losing interest, ask how familiar your customer already is with your product and brand. For instance, if they aren’t familiar with your product and haven’t even used your competitors’, you can start from the beginning. But if they are, you can steer the conversation towards your product’s USPs and differentiators.
Knowing the limitations of your product helps you give customers a realistic picture of what it can and can’t do. But most products are in a constant state of Work in Progress because innovation is a constant process
If your product team is open to customer feedback and always searching for ways to enhance what’s on offer, that’s a strength, not a weakness. Your product team may be rolling out new features and beta releases as you speak, but this is a sign of progress and improvement and that’s how your customers need to see it as well.

You get the opportunity to uncover what your customer wishes they could do better or faster or more efficiently, so you can highlight the features of your product that empower them to do that.

Wondering how to craft a sales pitch that converts every time?
A good sales pitch conveys the intended message to the target company or individual in a compelling manner. However, crafting a winning sales pitch every single time is not easy. In this article, we will learn how to create a killer sales pitch with well-defined pitch points that can turn the tide in your favor.
Before we move any further, it is imperative to know what a sales pitch is.
A sales pitch is a quick presentation, made in person or over the phone, explaining the product, its use benefits to the client. All this happens in less than a minute or two, so they’re also popularly termed “elevator pitches” as the time one gets to influence a client is approximately the same as an elevator ride. If you make a good sales pitch, chances are your client will be interested and you'll get more time to explain your product. So, a sales pitch is both a first impression and an opportunity to open a two-way dialogue with your client.
In this article, we will guide you on how to make a sales pitch over the call, as during the pandemic, it is the new normal. After this, we will discuss the key steps to prepare a good sales pitch along with relevant examples.
Pitching your sales pitch over the phone has become the new normal during the pandemic, but it's very different from an in-person pitch.
Being a cold call without face-to-face interaction, the individual at the other end may be less receptive. You have limited time to establish your credibility, build trust and win over your prospect.
Here are some tips to help.
Up next is a step-by-step guide to draft a selling pitch that has a high success rate.
A sales pitch has three key components.
The first part is the opening-- a brief introduction. The goal here is the catch the prospect's attention and it works best if you've researched your product and the client's needs.
Your opening line can make or break the deal-- the customer will make a snap decision whether to engage further with you or not.
The second part is the body of the pitch, where you explain how the product works. Here, speak to their needs, like a specific problem the product can solve, or emotional benefits such as being respected, liked, and recognized. Avoid industry jargon and connect with them at a human level, so they can engage.
The third part, the conclusion, consists of a "call-to-action," where you ask the prospect to take your desired action, such as agree to sign up for a demo or place their order.
Your name, designation, and company are enough detail. Don’t provide too much information about the company, except the punch line, like "we are a leading internet marketing agency with a decade of experience" or "a startup to make candidate background checks affordable for SMEs". The introduction has to be short so that you get to the main point.
Depending on the vibe, you may ask a question, like how their business survived before the pandemic or their opinion on a particular industry news item.
Cultivate the ability to modify your sales pitch on the spot. The best way to do this is to overprepare, research and respond proactively to the customer's unique context and constraints. Prepare different sets of pitches for different clients, such as price-sensitive clients or those with specific problems or concerns. Remember any objections they may have and prepare a rebuttal. Be confident and if you fumble, stay calm and rely on your practical industry experience.
You have to define the USP of your product in the body section. The USP is something your product has that is beneficial to your prospective customers, and not offered by your market rivals. Do your research here about why you're unique and offer relevant examples to demonstrate.
For instance, you could mention your product is both electricity and battery-operated, so if there is a power failure even for a minute, business operations wouldn't be affected. In general, avoid using price as your USP, unless you're priced significantly lower than your competitor or the client is highly price-sensitive.
One of the most important aspects of preparing a well-crafted sales pitch is to know your customer persona and tailor your pitch delivery to the person you are speaking with. Be aware of key demographic details such as age, education level, and income. Identify their pain points, and how your product can solve them. You have to imagine them using your product or service, so take them into consideration before you pick up your phone and make a sales pitch.
When you are drafting the body of a sales pitch (after you introduce yourself and before your USP) make sure to include probing questions to dig deeper into your client's pain points, and offer the best solutions.
For instance, if your digital marketing agency makes a pitch to clients, ask how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their sales? When do you think things will improve? Mention aspects of your USP the specific client finds valuable to genuinely draw their interest. But don’t overdo this-- if your prospective client is not willing to answer your query, move on.
Begin by figuring out your goal-- what you want to happen at the end of the call. Are you in pursuit of asking for a FREE demo? Do you want them to place an order? This will guide you in preparing a confident closing statement and call-to-action.
Quickly discern whether your prospective client’s needs are met by your product. Are they willing to take the pitch or do they need more information? If your goal is getting approval for a product demo, then the focus of your sales pitch must be primarily on the features & benefits of the product demo. In case you want them to place an order, then include the pricing aspect in the sales pitch. Explain how competitive you are, without being too salesy.
The purpose of a sales pitch is to get your prospect to make a decision or take any further action. Typically, clients don't make decisions right away. Recognize hurdles to their decision-making, for instance, do they want an in-person product demo or price cut? Offer options and flexibility, like with the time to schedule a consultation, to make it as easy as possible for them to say "yes".
Follow up! Make calls, or send a gentle reminder over mail. The follow-up need not be direct, either. For instance, first, appreciate having a great conversation over the phone call and express that it was good to know their business or problem. Then remind them of your solution, which can make their lives a lot easier.
The motive of a follow-up mail is to get them to take the next step. So make this as easy as possible for them. For instance, ask for a 10-minute call versus a half an hour call. Suggest an easy medium, like over the phone, versus an obscure app they'd have to download.
Make a direct ask only at the end, not at the beginning, otherwise, your prospective clients will put your mail id in the spam box. And do not disturb your client daily with an email, once a week is more than enough.
Finally, know when a client just won't convert and put them on the backburner for the time being to focus on easy to convert clients.
If you implement the above steps, you will significantly increase the odds of winning that big client with an impressive sales pitch. With SalesKen, you can now craft a winning sales pitch. Salesken’s Good Call Engine leverages the power of artificial intelligence to build a winning call profile unique to your organization.

When you are drafting the body of a sales pitch (after you introduce yourself and before your USP) make sure to include probing questions to dig deeper into your client's pain points, and offer the best solutions.
For instance, if your digital marketing agency makes a pitch to clients, ask how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their sales? When do you think things will improve? Mention aspects of your USP the specific client finds valuable to genuinely draw their interest. But don’t overdo this-- if your prospective client is not willing to answer your query, move on.
Begin by figuring out your goal-- what you want to happen at the end of the call. Are you in pursuit of asking for a FREE demo? Do you want them to place an order? This will guide you in preparing a confident closing statement and call-to-action.
Quickly discern whether your prospective client’s needs are met by your product. Are they willing to take the pitch or do they need more information? If your goal is getting approval for a product demo, then the focus of your sales pitch must be primarily on the features & benefits of the product demo. In case you want them to place an order, then include the pricing aspect in the sales pitch. Explain how competitive you are, without being too salesy.
The purpose of a sales pitch is to get your prospect to make a decision or take any further action. Typically, clients don't make decisions right away. Recognize hurdles to their decision-making, for instance, do they want an in-person product demo or price cut? Offer options and flexibility, like with the time to schedule a consultation, to make it as easy as possible for them to say "yes".
Follow up! Make calls, or send a gentle reminder over mail. The follow-up need not be direct, either. For instance, first, appreciate having a great conversation over the phone call and express that it was good to know their business or problem. Then remind them of your solution, which can make their lives a lot easier.
The motive of a follow-up mail is to get them to take the next step. So make this as easy as possible for them. For instance, ask for a 10-minute call versus a half an hour call. Suggest an easy medium, like over the phone, versus an obscure app they'd have to download.
Make a direct ask only at the end, not at the beginning, otherwise, your prospective clients will put your mail id in the spam box. And do not disturb your client daily with an email, once a week is more than enough.
Finally, know when a client just won't convert and put them on the backburner for the time being to focus on easy to convert clients.
If you implement the above steps, you will significantly increase the odds of winning that big client with an impressive sales pitch. With SalesKen, you can now craft a winning sales pitch. Salesken’s Good Call Engine leverages the power of artificial intelligence to build a winning call profile unique to your organization.

B2B sales representatives are among the most valuable resources for any organisation’s sales team. They are responsible for building an effective sales workflow from the research to the conversion stage and are the key driving force behind activities like customer acquisition, relationship building, and closing high-value deals.
Read on to learn what it takes to become a successful B2B sales representative!
B2B sales representatives play a different role than B2C sales representatives. B2C sales reps generally follow the organisational sales playbook to align with the sales processes, search for prospects’ backgrounds, and pitch solutions that address potential customers’ challenges.
B2B sales reps are responsible for building and nurturing connections with corporate decision-makers to sell various products and services. They do so through channels like sales calls, video conferencing and emails.
Business-to-business sales is all about selling products and services to other businesses instead of directly selling to customers. B2B sales is different from B2C sales as the sales cycle is longer, involves multiple touchpoints, and decision-makers, and the product being sold tends to be of higher value. As a result, one may need up to 3 months or longer to close a B2B sales deal.
Since B2B sales involves multiple decision-makers, each with their unique needs, the reps must handle every key stakeholder objection and allay their concerns to close the deal. Hence the term "complex sale" is associated with B2B sales.
For example, suppose a B2B sales development representative is selling project management software to the C-suite of a company. Different stakeholders in the prospects’ buying team (for example, the technology team, finance team, etc.) have different requirements and concerns regarding the software.
For instance, the finance team may care about budget-friendly pricing. The integration team may ask questions are the various channel or platform integrations. The projects team may want to know if it accommodates up to 100 users.
In such a situation, B2B sales representatives can successfully close the deal by building a package that matches the diverse requirements of various stakeholders. To do that, the sales representatives should have a clear idea of the key decision-makers and their requirements.
Business-to-business sales representatives are responsible for end-to-end management of B2B sales funnel, starting from lead generation to lead conversion. Some of the major responsibilities associated with B2B sales representatives include:
Here is a quick overview of the B2B sales process that B2B sales representatives follow:
The first step of the B2B sales and marketing cycle is research. B2B reps conduct a thorough investigation into the businesses that are most likely to benefit from the products and services, the demographics of the target prospects and the best ways to reach them. They must detect the key decision-maker in an organisation and connect with them directly. To learn this information, B2B reps explore multiple platforms like social media, websites, news portals, review portals, etc.
Prospecting is related to sending a cold email or making a cold call to prospective customers and building their interest. This stage helps them gain an idea about the readiness of the prospect to purchase the product or service.
In this stage, one performs a quick need assessment to identify the product-prospect fit. Some common areas to focus on in the discovery call include the prospect’s current issues, business objectives and budget. Once everyone has clear information on these aspects, suitable outreach strategies can be developed.
Once the needs of the prospect have been identified, the reps pitch the product. The sales representative is well aware of the prospect's challenges, and the pitch should proactively address the key needs and concerns of the prospects.
Prospects raise multiple objections in this stage. The more complex the solution, the more objections multiple stakeholders raise. But with proper preparation, reps can handle the objections and move the deal to the next stages.
Want to tackle objections like a pro? Check out how Salesken's real-time assistance can help with objection handling and closing the sale.
B2B selling is a prolonged, complex process. The sales reps need to negotiate with the corporate buyers a few times before closing deals. These requests can be related to pricing, features, implementation, and so on. The sales rep needs to negotiate all the terms and conditions correctly with the prospects to freeze the final deal.
In the B2B sales process, conversion is crucial. Many prospective B2B sales deals don’t convert into paid deals at this stage even after significant progress. The ones that do convert offer disproportionate returns on the overall effort. Therefore, planning and executing a smooth customer onboarding is mandatory in this stage.
The job of B2B sales representatives is challenging. Successful corporate sales representatives should possess and acquire the following sales skills to convert the challenges of B2B sales into opportunities:
Empathy is the #1 sales skill. It is a must for the B2B sales representatives to create a rapport with the corporate buyers, identify their needs and concerns, and offer suitable solutions. B2B reps with remarkable EQ don’t hesitate to admit if their products are not the perfect fit for the buyers. Addressing potential customers’ pain points is the top priority in B2B sales.
Active listening is an underrated professional skill. The sales rep must hear the prospect out before formulating their pitch. Remember, when you listen to the prospective customer, you hear their specific challenges, you can establish a genuine rapport, earn their trust and then provide the best solutions.
Corporate sales representatives are bound to face rejection and hear the word “no” a lot. Therefore, developing persistence skills is a must for sales reps. This trait helps the reps to remain motivated even after facing rejections. By being persistent, sales reps can stay objective, not personalise the rejection, and use the feedback to improve their outreach activities.
Sales reps are responsible for multiple activities like research, cold outreach, discovery calls, demo calls, and so on. Efficient time management is key to balancing all these tasks simultaneously and prioritising better.
Research is a major part of B2B selling and customer acquisition. A professional involved in selling should possess in-depth analytical skills to collect sufficient information about a business, its key stakeholders, its competitive positioning, and the current pain points they are facing.
Sales negotiation is not just about the discussion over the price but is a continuous affair starting from need identification, objection handling, finding solutions, and price discussions. Often, reps assume good negotiation is all about making the prospect accept their view. But, good negotiation is often about finding the middle ground and a solution acceptable to all the key stakeholders. Reps need to possess negotiation skills to ensure they can build genuine rapport with the prospects and win more deals.
Sales reps don’t need to be tech experts, but basic technical skills are a must to win deals. Buyers would never prefer to purchase from a rep who is unable to answer basic technical queries about the product. It is thus important for the reps to know what technology the product uses, data security, integrations, and other information to gain the trust of the prospect.
Sales reps should be able to create genuine rapport and be able to network with a wide variety of people. With strong networking skills, businesses can generate new leads, nurture relationships and create unlimited customer acquisition opportunities for their brand.
Sales reps must never mislead the prospect. Falsifying information or providing the prospect with incomplete information may move the deal down the funnel, but sooner or later, the prospect will figure it out and it will end up damaging the organisation's reputation in the market. It is always better to be honest, and upfront with the prospect about the product capabilities. If one is unable to answer a prospect's query, it is always better to accept it and get back to them later or seek help from others and provide the correct response to the prospect.
In modern sales, social media has become a dominant mode of selling, and reps must be able to leverage social media channels to nurture and convert leads. With social listening tools like Hootsuite and others, reps can now know who their ICPs are, what they are searching for, and their key needs and concerns. Reps with an active social media presence can then use the channels to educate the buyers about their product to their target customers. Also, social media can be a great way to network and create brand awareness.

Data is gold in today’s digital age. While companies can’t bear the cost of losing valuable data, the same goes for sales reps. It is imperative to update your contacts and gather as much information on prospects as possible.
More than 40% of sales reps say prospecting is the most demanding part of the sales call process. If you also find this nut difficult to crack, you’re not alone.
Instead of researching the buyer or creating a personalized note, the sales representatives should have an idea as to when to pick up the phone to call a prospect. Finding the best time to cold call comes from your homework and ability to convert the cold call into a warm call.
Nailing a cold call is not a walk in the park, especially for sales professionals. Many prospects straightaway reject what salespeople offer. At times, sales reps would hang up before the cold callers would begin the pitch.
Recent estimates suggest that it takes 209 calls to bag the first appointment. Imagine the intensity of efforts that sales reps put in secure prospects. However, they also waste a good number of working hours leaving voicemails. Of course, connecting with a lead is a massive task.
Now, let’s have a look at the common mistakes sales reps make during cold calling:
The only thing that salespeople need to understand to combat such inaccuracies is to ‘do it right’. So, learn about the prospect's requirements, find the most opportune time to connect with them, and understand how to be more efficient when talking to them.
The best time of day to cold call is between (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM), your prospect’s local time. This is the time when people have completed 80% of their work and mostly be at their desks.
Now, let’s dig deeper in detail to identify what is the best time to make sales calls and hit your target number:
It makes sense to make morning calls to your prospects. The best thing is you get to connect with them before they kick start their to-do lists. The right time to call your prospect is (11:00 AM - 12:00 PM).
During these hours, most people are finishing their tasks before having lunch. Similar is the scenario with the 4:00 PM slot when employees are winding up their day.
As per the CallHippo study, Wednesday and Thursday remain the best days of the week to call prospective customers.
Now, it totally makes sense to not bother people on Fridays as they are looking forward to their weekend party and not to begin a relationship with the sales rep.
Mondays and Tuesdays are mostly for planning the week ahead. By the mid of the week, people have had created some space to take a few critical tasks.
Your best response time is the one hour within which you receive a query from your potential lead. CallHippo found a 450% difference in response time for leads that received a call and those that didn’t.
So act quickly to your lead actions. They are the ones who lead you to sell the product eventually.
Usually, office hours begin between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. During these early hours, professionals are occupied in the hustle and bustle of work which makes these hours the worst to make calls.
There is a lot of uncertainty that anyone will be available to answer your call. Just when the employees reach their offers, the first couple of hours are spent planning the day ahead.
Thus, refrain from calling decision-makers and experts at peak hours if you want yourself to be heard properly.
Sales representatives have a 95% success rate on making contact with their lead on the 6th call. Also, by making a few more call attempts, sales representatives can easily attain an 80% growth rate in contact rate.
If your job involves converting prospects into customers and assume you can accomplish a 70% growth in contact rates, 6 calls scheduled over a 15-day time period can get contact rates improved by 110%.
There is no strict formula to make a fantastic sales call. Below-mentioned is some of the best techniques that you may find useful to interact better with your clients:
When it comes to calling your prospects, plan in advance so that you connect with your prospects at the right time. This way, you can effectively engage with them and this can improve your conversions.
To pace your sales success, choosing the ideal time is crucial. Implement these cold-calling sales techniques for your business and see what suits your sales model. Right after a few sales amendments, you will come across so many prospects reaching out to you.
However, making an impactful call has the right balance of how, what and, when to do it so you can reap the best results. So, apply these basic practices and customize them based upon the calls.
Hopefully, you find the information mentioned above insightful to find the best time of day to cold call.
In fact, there are many sales call software available to track your call schedules, call duration, type of call, and success rate. These insights help you find what time your prospects want to hear from you.
Happy prospecting! Be sure to ring your prospect at their convenience.

There is no strict formula to make a fantastic sales call. Below-mentioned is some of the best techniques that you may find useful to interact better with your clients:
When it comes to calling your prospects, plan in advance so that you connect with your prospects at the right time. This way, you can effectively engage with them and this can improve your conversions.
To pace your sales success, choosing the ideal time is crucial. Implement these cold-calling sales techniques for your business and see what suits your sales model. Right after a few sales amendments, you will come across so many prospects reaching out to you.
However, making an impactful call has the right balance of how, what and, when to do it so you can reap the best results. So, apply these basic practices and customize them based upon the calls.
Hopefully, you find the information mentioned above insightful to find the best time of day to cold call.
In fact, there are many sales call software available to track your call schedules, call duration, type of call, and success rate. These insights help you find what time your prospects want to hear from you.
Happy prospecting! Be sure to ring your prospect at their convenience.

The B2B sales funnel concept is one of the very first concepts sales and marketing professionals learn. Although many feel that the B2B sales funnel concept is on its way to extinction, we disagree. Any sales professional aiming at making it BIG should know about ways to build and optimise a B2B sales funnel.
This article plans to give you a comprehensive overview of the concept of the B2B sales funnel along with practical strategies to optimise it. So, let’s get started!
The B2B sales funnel is a concept that helps you understand the potential stages your prospective client follows before making a purchase decision in a business-to-business (B2B) setup. As a sales professional, you need to interact with the prospects at each stage to persuade them.
The structure of a B2B sales funnel involves three different aspects, namely top, middle and bottom.
The top of the B2B sales funnel is about awareness and attraction. It's when prospects typically try to look for your content. It's a vast part of the funnel and includes casual exploratory activities like reading blogs, eBooks, whitepapers, watching videos, and listening to your podcasts.
If the prospects like your content, they’ll slide into the middle region of the sales funnel, which is about engagement. Here, interested prospects may download your resources, sign up for your webinars or share their contact details. Any details like email address, contact number, organisation’s name, etc. must go to your sales team right away, so that they can make the most of it.
This is the narrowest region of your B2B sales funnel. Here the prospects may sign up for a product demo or free trial. Once the demo is over, the prospects make their final purchase decision on whether or not to collaborate with you.
Any B2B sales pipeline funnel involves four stages. Let’s get a brief idea of these stages before we move on to the building part:
This stage resides at the top region of a B2B sales funnel. This is when a prospect hears about your company, its products, and its services for the first time. And to explore further, they may visit your website, read your content or watch your videos.
The prospects who move to the next stage of the sales funnel are the ones who find your products and services interesting. They try to investigate your brand further. Also, this is the very stage where they compare your offerings with that of the competitors to learn who offers the best value at the minimum price.
Here the prospects have all the Desire they need, and they’re all set to make a decision. They typically engage in discovery calls or watch demos at this stage to better understand the features, negotiate pricing and so on. This is the stage where they make their final decision.
Based on the above stages, the prospect either selects you and becomes a customer or rejects the offer.
Now that you know about the B2B sales funnel stages, let us discuss how you can build an effective one for your brand:
You can’t plan your B2B conversion funnel without knowing who the customers are and what they want. So, before building a B2B sales funnel, understand what your customers and prospects are looking for. For long-term growth, focusing on customers’ needs is the ultimate key.
Here’s what you should do to understand customers’ expectations:
There’s no point in building a B2B sales funnel with less interested prospects. Instead, use sales acceleration software to populate your B2B pipeline with valuable leads. Such software helps you with the following:
Ensure that there is open communication with your prospects at each stage of the B2B sales funnel. That’s the key to nurture and persuade the leads to purchase your products and services. There are three ways to structure your communication process:
Make sure to create a transparent communication process where all questions from your prospects get answered.
Follow-ups are crucial to building a B2B sales funnel.
Following up is the key to retain valuable leads. However, the follow-up process should not get annoying for the prospects. That may lead to missing out on strong sales opportunities.
Here’s what you should do to make the follow-up process effective:
Also, don’t forget to follow up with your existing customers.
Make sure that your sales and marketing teams are well connected. There should be no conflict between these two teams on who will dominate the B2B sales funnel. Instead, they should collaborate to speed up your lead generation and conversion process. Both teams should have a common goal, i.e. to generate, nurture and convert leads.
Building a sales funnel is not that easy. A lot of effort goes into it. Here’re some challenges that you might face in this process:
The B2B market is highly competitive. That makes the creation and maintenance of a B2B sales funnel challenging. If you’re not putting in data-driven inbound efforts, you may end up losing to your competitors. Additionally, buyers’ behaviours keep changing and you need to create or adjust your touchpoints based on the changing nature of buyers, which can be challenging.
Lead generation is another roadblock in the way of sales funnel creation. Did you know that 61% of marketers consider lead generation the biggest challenge in building a B2B sales funnel? Many B2B industries are getting close to saturation, leaving the sales and marketing professionals with declining leads.
Many times, sales reps are confused about which metrics to track. They are not adequately aware of which metrics can make or break their B2B sales funnels. The result is the inability to build a proper sales strategy that can increase ROI.
Wondering how to optimise your SaaS sales funnel stages? Salesken’s sales acceleration tool can help you with that. Many organizations have improved their sales funnel by 70% with the help of SalesKen. Here’s how we do it:

Questions such as "How to increase sales?" and "How to be successful in sales?" are the most recurring issues that consistently run through a sales rep's mind.
Let's face it: selling a product is tough.
Additionally, business owners are cognizant of the fact that increasing sales is crucial for their company's growth. If there's one metric that actually measures the health quotient of a company, then it's by gauging its sales volume.
To reach the maximum potential, a company must have effective strategies to increase the number of customers and ultimately, improve sales.
Globally, businesses are constantly looking to increase their sales numbers which continues to remain an uphill task. Several products and businesses have been developed to assist other businesses to improve and meet their sales targets.
If you're looking for tips to boost sales for your business, you're at the right place!
In this blog, we'll discuss why increasing sales is important and 10 go-to tips to boost sales for any business in 2023, big or small.
Let's begin.
Sales growth measures the change in revenue of an organization over a fixed time period - say between 2 quarters or between 2 months. growth measures how quickly a company has been growing its revenue, or sales.
It is calculated as using the formula:
A positive sales growth indicated operational efficiency, and high confidence of the customers with the particular company. While a negative growth rate could imply that the organizations need to improve its processes to remain sustainable.
Sales are essentially, the number of goods and products that were sold in a particular time period by a business. Typically, a person or a company conveys their interest in the product, or services you are selling and will offer money to get that for themselves.
When the transaction is done, and the product is handed over to the person, a sale is made.
As we're all aware, sales are the primary source of revenue for a company. Without substantial sales growth, a company will suffer a steep loss in terms of revenue, sometimes leading to acquisition of the company, or shutting it down altogether.
In addition, it also plays a vital role for the company to withstand the market trends.
Sales leaders that learn and acclimatize processes to maximize their sales and build lasting relationships with their customers grow to become a large, successful company.
Sales teams are not the only team responsible for increasing sales - it is a collective effort by teams of all departments. Leaders of a company should jot down an exhaustive plan that consists of a set of actions every department needs to compete and win against their competitors.
The following tips will help you move from interest to engagement to conversion, and thus boost sales this year. Let's start.
Customers are a company's most important asset.
Understanding their needs, pain points, challenges, fears, and desires can help you go a long way, and also sell your product with ease.
When you genuinely engage with your prospects and listen to their questions and shortcomings, you have a chance to understand their concerns better. This not only helps you build lasting relationships with your customers but also improves your product.
When you engage with your customers to genuinely help them out and not to make a sale, you build loyalty and gain their trust because you served them well.
Another way to understand your customers well, including potential and existing customers, is by sending out surveys to help understand how well they like your service and share their opinions, too.
Based on their inputs, you can make necessary changes to your processes and product, if needed.
We're all aware of customer rewards programs, and a ton of businesses have it in place, and for a good reason.
Having a simple discount, referral program, and add-ons can go a long way. Incentivize and offer a reward every time your customer completes a milestone such as providing customer testimonials, or is leveraging your product regularly.
Done right, rewards programs can help build customer loyalty and also, increase sales.
A business cannot thrive on its own.
All companies need a consistent and strong marketing plan to reach its customers. Create a marketing plan that leverages all omni channels, including digital and physical channels such as social media, customer testimonials, offline marketing, and more.
Having a consistent marketing plan that aligns with the sales process can help you receive more leads that match your services, promote the product so prospects are aware of its existence, increase sales, and more.
Leverage free resources such as Google to maximize your reach to new customers and ensure your company appears in the search results.
Google My Business is a free tool by Google that can be used to set up your business profile and jot down your services that help prospects learn more about you and your product.
Your company profile will appear in the local section of Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Knowledge Panel. Optimize your listing to stand out against your competitors by following easy tips and practices, and thus, stay on top of the listing.
Encourage your existing customers to provide customer testimonials, and reviews and when done, reward them. It's a win-win!
It's ubiquitous that selling to existing customers is 10 times easier and affordable than selling to new customers.
To make this a possibility, try increasing the cart value and review your current price. Look for complimentary products that can be added with the current purchase, and increase the frequency of purchases.
Although this may be dependent on the niche of your business, nonetheless, provide more value by offering exclusive deals and promotions for customers to return more often.
A lot of customers struggle with payment options provided by an organization.
Sometimes, payment choices provided are not usually compatible with every customer, especially if they belong to different geographies.
Some prefer credit cards, some net banking, while others prefer digital methods such as PayPal or Apple Pay.
If you provide only standard options such as credit card payment methods, you are essentially limiting the pool of customers to credit card holders. Include other popular payment choices to improve sales and allow potential customers to make purchases with the payment method they prefer.
Team selling is one of the most popular ways to close a deal and gain your customers' trust.
There are a variety of ways to indoctrinate this technique. Team selling allows you to keep important people in your sales process informed, exchange ideas together to provide value in your offerings, and establish authority.
Have two sales reps work together on one deal, or introduce a senior manager to answer important questions about the product. You can even split up teams into pairs of reps based on their performance for a contest to improve sales.
While one-off purchases may help boost sales over the short term, however, continued spending from loyal customers add up to your revenue over time.
It's worth calculating lifetime customer value (LCV) to understand how much customers buy and spend over time. Based on this, you can then adjust your sales process to match.
Know that, for buyers who are satisfied with your services or product, less work is required to drive more purchases.
Prioritize these buyers by including special offers, reducing price by offering discounts, and enhancing their experience so customers trust you and your team.
What are the odds that you aren't the only organization selling your product?
Learning and analyzing your competitors is critical to be able to explain the benefits your customers will receive after purchasing your services.
It is not uncommon to expect questions such as "How are you better than your competitors?". It is better to develop your competition advantage than be dumbfounded during a live call.
Conduct a simple research and get answers to questions such as : ‍"How is my competition selling their products and what are their claims?", "What are the benefits they are selling?", "How are our services different?", "How can I get better?", and more.
Picking the right price for your service is necessary to the long term success of your business.
Pick too low a price, and you may find it hard to remain sustainable, and pick too high a price, your competition could simply capture the market by offering a lower price.
The price you pick should depend on the potential of your customer, the positioning of your brand and the price quoted by your competitors.
Luxury brands are typically priced higher than the ones used for large-scale consumption, as they create a sense of exclusivity and the people who use the service or product would derive satisfaction from using a non-common brand.
In this case, the volume of sales will be low.
Of course, it totally goes without saying that the quality of the service offered or the product should match the price charged.
Similarly, commodities of mass consumption are priced lower to attract more customers, and generate higher volume of sales, and revenue.
Do not let stale selling strategies foul up your year or quarter.
It's 2023 and it is of the utmost importance to keep up with the latest sales and marketing trends to improve sales. Infuse new life into your existing sales process by practicing new techniques listed above.
In doing so, you'll not only access greater heights in your role, but also nurture a strong sales team, enhance close rates, and foster lasting connections with customers who feel appreciated, and thus, boosting sales.
If you're looking to improve your closing rates and boost sales in more ways than just one, jump on the bandwagon of intuitive sales tool. Book a demo with Salesken today and get started!

The global market for artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to touch $60 billion by 2025. AI is everywhere, in just about any industry, right from hospitality to manufacturing. It’s also transforming several business functions from marketing to customer service. AI can transform your SaaS business too, and specifically, the all-important sales function, which directly impacts your bottom line.
Investing in a Sales AI tool can help you save time and money and boost sales. It can help you focus on high-quality leads, better educate your customers, create and edit documents, improve your reporting and follow up more easily.
With the software market being competitive, a powerful AI tool can help you boost software sales. Read on to learn how!
AI tools can help software sales teams eliminate repetitive tasks like emails, scheduling, manual CRM data entry, and more. In addition, automating key workflows can help SaaS sales teams enhance overall efficiency.
An automated sales tool can standardise the process of making a sale, right from generating a lead, converting the lead, to reporting. The sales tool can make the whole process very plug-and-play. It also saves time by providing you all the information you need in a matter of minutes, rather than spending hours manually scrutinising data.
Nowadays, lead generation has become much easier thanks to an increase in lead gen channels, like different social media. AI tools can still help in this process. They also find and engage prospective clients that are similar to the ones with whom you had a deal earlier. Moreover, determining which prospects are ready to make the software buying decision is still very complex. Lead prospecting can be made more precise with AI tools that offer predictive analytics. These tools assimilate data such as demographics to prepare well-defined buyer personas, which can more accurately identify the characteristics of a prospective client who will likely make a purchase.
Personalisation is imperative to a customer's sales journey. By applying AI, several steps of the software sales journey, such as lead nurturing and qualification can be automated to deliver a tailored experience. AI tools like Salesken can help handle prospects, monitor their progress, and determine when they’re ready to buy. They can discover the pain points and intent of your target audience, so you can tailor your pitch accordingly, thus, improving the odds of making a successful sale. This can also help with upselling if needed.
Retaining an existing customer costs a fraction of acquiring a new customer, making customer retention is crucial. AI-powered predictive analytics can help you understand how and where your company is losing customers, whether it’s due to a feature problem or poor customer support. This helps reduce churn and empowers your company to improve customer satisfaction too.
AI-based tools for the software sales team can help schedule when, how, and where to connect with sales prospects. They ensure the communication is on time and swift, and your sales team doesn’t miss out on any sale just because they forget about the call with a prospect.
These tools work by automatically scheduling conversations with your prospects through your email. They engage your prospects by checking their availability and confirming a sales call. They also send out reminders to both your software sales team and potential clients. Your prospects can reschedule their meeting using such a tool as well. Booking more prospects for a call and making honouring those meetings a smoother process can help close more deals.
With AI, you need not guess the best-discounted price to get the deal done. To develop the best offer, AI tools like Salesken provide crucial customer data, such as location, demographics, intent, and earlier successful sales. As a result, personalised pricing speeds up the software sales process, smoothens customer experience by eliminating too many back-and-forth negotiations and increases the chances of making a sale. Plus, you need not worry about the margins, as the best offers you get are pre-authorised and protected by markdown guardrails.
AI can help provide key insights into prospective customers by analysing the customer databases and then making predictions. So you need not invest as much in expensive data teams to obtain crucial insights.
AI tools like Salesken can act as a single source of information for your sales rep with details of your prospective client from across different platforms, right from CRM, legacy databases, email, social media platforms, and calendar. These tools deliver on three key facets-- a faster sales cycles, greater sales productivity, and improved win rates.
Using a Sales AI tool for selling B2B software can help companies evaluate how their sales team is performing, and improve the performance of individual sales reps and the team as a whole. Conversation AI platforms like Salesken provide smart assistance to Sales reps so that they can make a natural conversation with the customer, reach out to prospects multiple times and convince them to invest in your software and save crucial time. With benefits like personalised pitches, call scheduling, price optimisation and rich data analytics, AI can help make the whole process of selling software extremely smooth and efficient!
Before you invest in a sales tool, it is imperative that you first define your objective of using the tool to make a well-informed decision. If you aim to increase sales, look no further than SalesKen! SalesKen leverages the power of AI to augment sales intelligence. It helps you analyse every sales call to highlight customers’ intent, objections, needs, and expectations, so you can easily guide your reps in the right direction and convert more leads!

A B2B sales cycle is specifically designed to assist sales teams throughout the prolonged B2B sales process. It is scalable and includes appropriate instructions that prospects can use from the prospecting stage to the conversion stage.
This guide will extensively describe the B2B sales process and its different stages to help the Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) close more deals. It also includes some of the success factors to drive the sales process.
A sales cycle is the combination of all stages that a sales rep must follow to convert a prospect into a customer. Businesses that follow sales cycles closely can:
The ultimate goal of any B2B sales team is to close more sales deals. Mapping up a sales process is the first step toward fulfilling that goal. A B2B sales process is a complex process that takes part between two businesses and requires complete collaboration from both sides to make it successful.
Sales reps are often caught explaining how they enjoy the freedom associated with their jobs. They find it compelling how they can connect with new prospects over cold calls and convince them with their strong persuasion skills. However, one of the proven ways to win sales deals is by deriving actionable insights from B2B sales datasets and developing a personalized sales process.
Here’s why sales teams need a dedicated B2B sales process to succeed:
The length of a sales cycle depends on multiple factors. Usually, it is a time-consuming process as multiple decision-makers are involved. However, the most common stages of a sales process are as follows:
A sales cycle starts with prospecting. The prospecting stage is all about identifying the potential customers who are currently at the evaluation stage of their buyer’s journey and are likely to find your commercial offer interesting.
Some of the major channels that help B2B sales reps in the prospecting process include:
The above steps can help sales professionals to identify ideal leads and ensure that the very first contact can be established through:
Knowing a product closely is essential for every B2B sales rep. However, to influence a buyer’s journey, sales reps must know the prospect’s business and their challenges. In fact, the difference between a good SDR and a great SDR lies in their level of research about the prospect.
The next stage in the sales process is in-depth prospect research. Here are some tips to capture more information about the prospects:
An unaltered principle in B2B sales is - Make your sales process need-driven, not product-driven. Hence, it is very important to identify prospects’ needs and match them with your product to understand whether or not your product can solve their problems.
With thorough research, sales reps can develop a fundamental idea about the prospects. However, they need to ask questions to know their pain points more efficiently. A set of thought-provoking, open-ended questions can help the reps gain more clarity and establish prospects’ reliability over your brand.
Here are a few questions to ask to accelerate the lead qualification process:
After the lead qualification stage, a sales rep will have a clear idea of the prospect’s intent, struggles, and how their product can help the prospects. Hence, in this sales cycle stage, reps should focus on crafting a tailored pitch.
Crafting a perfect sales pitch has its share of challenges. The pitch decides whether or not a prospect would proceed with a company. A good pitch should be brief, informative, and must consist of all your research insights.
Here are some quick tips to craft an effective B2B sales pitch:
A prospect can raise objections for multiple reasons like pricing, requesting additional features, queries about value addition, and so on. A B2B sales rep needs to address these objections with a positive approach and convert these objections into motivations to buy the product.
For example, if a prospect objects to the product's high price, remind them about the numerous benefits associated with it.
However, that’s not it. In B2B sales, it is very common to face recurring objections from prospects throughout the buyer’s journey. Hence, sales managers and VPs should make the SDRs aware of these challenges and include the correct approaches to resolve these in their sales playbook.
Closing is the most exciting and the most difficult stage in the sales cycle. By now, a prospect has clearly communicated the value of the product and addressed their objections and the only step left is to sign the contract and close the deal.
However, the closing stage is difficult because not all deals that reach this stage convert into closing. A research by Salesforce shows that only 28% of sales reps understand customers’ challenges and are more likely to close a deal. Therefore, the significance of customer-driven sales holds true in this stage too.
Sometimes, the reps need to negotiate pricing even in the closing stage. Providing the prospects with some free value like - a free trial for 14 days, free user guides, etc. can help in closing the deal.
Generally, after a sales call, reps should send the next steps, a recording of the conversation, and other useful resources over a follow-up mail. This nice gesture leaves the room open for more upsell and cross-sell opportunities.
A sales cycle is difficult to set up and even more challenging to execute! Here is a list of success factors to keep in mind to accelerate the B2B sales cycle for your brand:
Using the right set of sales tools can make a difference in your sales cycle. A tool that we found useful is - Salesken. It can help B2B organizations set up their sales cycle from scratch. Some of the core features of this tool include:

Forming an efficient sales team plays a critical role in the B2B sales process. A passionate and experienced sales manager must lead the team and encourage the reps to stay motivated throughout.
Also, it is important to assign the right person for the right responsibilities. For example, a person who enjoys interacting with others will be perfect for making cold calls and reaching out to the audience. Alternatively, a person with well-written communication skills can write outbound emails and messages for the team.
Additionally, a sales team should also have a dedicated coach who trains the new reps and helps them adapt to the company's sales processes.
A major success factor for a successful B2B sales process is to map the user’s journey. While most sales teams put efforts into creating and publishing content and launching ad campaigns, they often miss out on placing these assets in the appropriate channels to gain maximum visibility from the user.
The key here is to differentiate between entry-level and ready-to-convert users and segment your content accordingly. As soon as you segment your target audience and their position in the buyer’s journey, it will be easier to run successful campaigns and convert more users.
For each sales campaign, there should be:
Mapping the user journey can help accelerate the buyer’s journey and helps you simplify the conversion process.
There are different business users all over the internet, looking for the ideal products that can resolve their challenges. A sales rep’s job is to bridge the gap between the target users and the organization’s offerings. A great way to address this gap is by setting up a personalized sales cycle. It may be a time-consuming process, but it makes a lot of difference when planned correctly.
The length of a B2B sales cycle depends on many things like the product you are selling, the prospect company, no. of stakeholders involved, and so on. Though there is no specific length, a study by CSO insights points out that three-quarters of B2B sales take a minimum of 4 months to complete.

The seven stages of a sales process are:

A B2B sales cycle is specifically designed to assist sales teams throughout the prolonged B2B sales process. It is scalable and includes appropriate instructions that prospects can use from the prospecting stage to the conversion stage.
This guide will extensively describe the B2B sales process and its different stages to help the Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) close more deals. It also includes some of the success factors to drive the sales process.
A sales cycle is the combination of all stages that a sales rep must follow to convert a prospect into a customer. Businesses that follow sales cycles closely can:
The ultimate goal of any B2B sales team is to close more sales deals. Mapping up a sales process is the first step toward fulfilling that goal. A B2B sales process is a complex process that takes part between two businesses and requires complete collaboration from both sides to make it successful.
Sales reps are often caught explaining how they enjoy the freedom associated with their jobs. They find it compelling how they can connect with new prospects over cold calls and convince them with their strong persuasion skills. However, one of the proven ways to win sales deals is by deriving actionable insights from B2B sales datasets and developing a personalized sales process.
Here’s why sales teams need a dedicated B2B sales process to succeed:
The length of a sales cycle depends on multiple factors. Usually, it is a time-consuming process as multiple decision-makers are involved. However, the most common stages of a sales process are as follows:
A sales cycle starts with prospecting. The prospecting stage is all about identifying the potential customers who are currently at the evaluation stage of their buyer’s journey and are likely to find your commercial offer interesting.
Some of the major channels that help B2B sales reps in the prospecting process include:
The above steps can help sales professionals to identify ideal leads and ensure that the very first contact can be established through:
Knowing a product closely is essential for every B2B sales rep. However, to influence a buyer’s journey, sales reps must know the prospect’s business and their challenges. In fact, the difference between a good SDR and a great SDR lies in their level of research about the prospect.
The next stage in the sales process is in-depth prospect research. Here are some tips to capture more information about the prospects:
An unaltered principle in B2B sales is - Make your sales process need-driven, not product-driven. Hence, it is very important to identify prospects’ needs and match them with your product to understand whether or not your product can solve their problems.
With thorough research, sales reps can develop a fundamental idea about the prospects. However, they need to ask questions to know their pain points more efficiently. A set of thought-provoking, open-ended questions can help the reps gain more clarity and establish prospects’ reliability over your brand.
Here are a few questions to ask to accelerate the lead qualification process:
After the lead qualification stage, a sales rep will have a clear idea of the prospect’s intent, struggles, and how their product can help the prospects. Hence, in this sales cycle stage, reps should focus on crafting a tailored pitch.
Crafting a perfect sales pitch has its share of challenges. The pitch decides whether or not a prospect would proceed with a company. A good pitch should be brief, informative, and must consist of all your research insights.
Here are some quick tips to craft an effective B2B sales pitch:
A prospect can raise objections for multiple reasons like pricing, requesting additional features, queries about value addition, and so on. A B2B sales rep needs to address these objections with a positive approach and convert these objections into motivations to buy the product.
For example, if a prospect objects to the product's high price, remind them about the numerous benefits associated with it.
However, that’s not it. In B2B sales, it is very common to face recurring objections from prospects throughout the buyer’s journey. Hence, sales managers and VPs should make the SDRs aware of these challenges and include the correct approaches to resolve these in their sales playbook.
Closing is the most exciting and the most difficult stage in the sales cycle. By now, a prospect has clearly communicated the value of the product and addressed their objections and the only step left is to sign the contract and close the deal.
However, the closing stage is difficult because not all deals that reach this stage convert into closing. A research by Salesforce shows that only 28% of sales reps understand customers’ challenges and are more likely to close a deal. Therefore, the significance of customer-driven sales holds true in this stage too.
Sometimes, the reps need to negotiate pricing even in the closing stage. Providing the prospects with some free value like - a free trial for 14 days, free user guides, etc. can help in closing the deal.
Generally, after a sales call, reps should send the next steps, a recording of the conversation, and other useful resources over a follow-up mail. This nice gesture leaves the room open for more upsell and cross-sell opportunities.
A sales cycle is difficult to set up and even more challenging to execute! Here is a list of success factors to keep in mind to accelerate the B2B sales cycle for your brand:
Using the right set of sales tools can make a difference in your sales cycle. A tool that we found useful is - Salesken. It can help B2B organizations set up their sales cycle from scratch. Some of the core features of this tool include:

Forming an efficient sales team plays a critical role in the B2B sales process. A passionate and experienced sales manager must lead the team and encourage the reps to stay motivated throughout.
Also, it is important to assign the right person for the right responsibilities. For example, a person who enjoys interacting with others will be perfect for making cold calls and reaching out to the audience. Alternatively, a person with well-written communication skills can write outbound emails and messages for the team.
Additionally, a sales team should also have a dedicated coach who trains the new reps and helps them adapt to the company's sales processes.
A major success factor for a successful B2B sales process is to map the user’s journey. While most sales teams put efforts into creating and publishing content and launching ad campaigns, they often miss out on placing these assets in the appropriate channels to gain maximum visibility from the user.
The key here is to differentiate between entry-level and ready-to-convert users and segment your content accordingly. As soon as you segment your target audience and their position in the buyer’s journey, it will be easier to run successful campaigns and convert more users.
For each sales campaign, there should be:
Mapping the user journey can help accelerate the buyer’s journey and helps you simplify the conversion process.
There are different business users all over the internet, looking for the ideal products that can resolve their challenges. A sales rep’s job is to bridge the gap between the target users and the organization’s offerings. A great way to address this gap is by setting up a personalized sales cycle. It may be a time-consuming process, but it makes a lot of difference when planned correctly.
The length of a B2B sales cycle depends on many things like the product you are selling, the prospect company, no. of stakeholders involved, and so on. Though there is no specific length, a study by CSO insights points out that three-quarters of B2B sales take a minimum of 4 months to complete.

The seven stages of a sales process are:

“Inside sales” refers to any sales approach that is performed remotely. In the B2B context, inside sales has become a top sales model for selling SaaS solutions, digital products, and other technological assets. B2B inside sales reps have to be highly skilled as they handle the majority of the sales process through emails and phone communication. Some other significant responsibilities of B2B inside sales reps include conducting product demo sessions, relationship building, and providing presentations, along with regular sales activities.
Traditionally, inside sales and field sales were two completely different sales approaches. However, with the pandemic induced lockdowns,and the subsequent shift to a work from anywhere environment, inside sales has become the most dominant mode of selling and all sales operations are being conducted remotely. This transition has been made easier because of the availability of advanced tools - CRMs, call analytics software, sales enablement solutions, and others.
B2B inside sales is often complex and a lengthy process. Your inside sales team should be well versed in the structure of a B2B inside sales deal to win more customers. Here’s a sneak peek into the B2B inside sales system:
The very first step of B2B inside sales is to identify your target buyer profiles. Apart from in-depth research, inside sales teams should know the following about their buyers to determine if they are the right fit or not:The general trends - scope, future earnings, trends - to which the customers belong
Depending upon your organization and its offerings, the lead generation process may vary in B2B inside sales. However, the sales reps must remember that the common goal of any B2B inside sales process is lead generation.
Now, note that a lead and a prospect are not the same. A prospect matches your buyer persona but is still not aware of your brand. Alternatively, a lead expresses interest in your business, usually by filling out a form on your website but is not necessarily someone that fits the buyer persona.
Your inside sales team must be fully aware of this difference and work with the marketing team to generate more prospects who are a perfect product-fit for your organization. Converting the qualified prospects into leads should be the #1 goal of inside sales teams.
A crucial part of B2B inside sales is outreach campaigns. In this stage of the inside sales process, B2B sales reps reach out to prospects, build the prospects’ interest and increase their awareness of your offerings.
There are different types of channels for outreach campaigns like cold emails, social media outreach, cold calling, etc. The focal point of any outreach campaign should be to understand the challenges a lead faces and where your product fits in.
Depending on the effectiveness of your outreach campaign, you can get any of the following responses:
This stage in the B2B inside sales process is when the sales rep presents the product to the lead.
When in a demo call, make sure that you don’t only explain the product and its features to the lead in isolation. Instead, ask them about their problems and explain how your product fixes them. You can also give the leads limited access to your solution so they can play around a little with the product and understand its benefits.
By the end of this stage, your leads are well aware of the product and its critical features and are in a position to decide whether to buy the product or not.
This is the final stage of B2B inside sales. In this stage, the sales reps can again discuss the offerings, validate the discussed pricing, and freeze the deal.
Now, it's time for the customer success teams to take over and onboard the customer.
In outside sales, sales professionals meet prospective customers, set up appointments, show product demos, and convert leads into sales
There are some clear differences between inside sales and outside sales, in the business-to-business context. Let us differentiate these two sales approaches based on four factors: cost-effectiveness, customer-centricity, collaboration potential and productivity.
On average, outside sales calls are six times more expensive than inside sales calls. B2B inside sales reps leverage the power of technology to connect with many leads and B2B decision-makers, as compared to outside sales reps.
With changing market and technological trends, customers’ mindsets have also changed. In fact, 70% of customers prefer virtual meetings over in-person meetings. Virtual meetings are an excellent time-saver and include sufficient room for discussion and understanding of the product.
B2B sales deals involve multiple touchpoints. As a result, these sales deals tend to take more time to convert. However, things become easier for the sales reps if they have sufficient collaboration opportunities.
For example, as a sales rep, you cannot connect with all decision-makers in your prospects’ team. You need help from the sales team to connect with marketers, managers, and other stakeholders to nurture a lead. For inside sales, collaboration is simpler with advanced CRM tools, video conferencing tools, speech analytics software and so on.
Alternatively, an field sales team is focused on in-person interaction with the prospects. Hence, it becomes an obstacle for them to collaborate with different sales team members at the same time and approach the prospects as a team.
Inside sales teams have a lot of sales acceleration tools to support them. For instance, Salesken helps B2B inside sales reps with:
AI-powered tools make the job of the inside sales reps a lot easier. They work as an instant productivity booster for the sales reps and motivate them to leverage customer data better.
On the contrary, the outside sales approach has limited technical support as the reps need to initiate physical meetings with the prospects. This could mean declining productivity and fast burn-out for the sales reps.
If you’re trying to master the art of B2B inside sales, book a demo with Salesken and find out how it can support you throughout.
Inside sales is more flexible, affordable and scalable than outside sales.
Inside sales reps manage the entire sales process remotely. The resulting location flexibility is a critical advantage. For instance, your sales team based out of Japan can close a deal with a US-based client without any excess costs.
Inside sales reps save on time spent commuting. They are 100% invested in sales activities, which helps with productivity. Overall costs are lower than outside sales, resource allocation is more optimal and the scope of conversion is higher.
As inside sales broadens the opportunities to work with a world-class sales team, scalability is a major advantage.
B2B sales funnels are already long, and you don’t want to lengthen it further with other obstacles like an onsite meeting. The post-pandemic world has become eunpredictable. There is no point in promising in-person meeting with the prospects that sales reps cannot fulfil. Alternatively, with inside sales, every funnel stage is obstacle-free, and the prospects can slide across different stages independently.
Inside sales is not all hunky-dory. If you look closely, there are some disadvantages too. Here are a few disadvantages that you should be aware of:
Inside sales is completely dependent on virtual interactions. Hence, many a time, sales reps can feel that the emotional touch is missing from their sales pitches. This may result in lesser trust dependency and can become a barrier in the path of closing a deal.
Inside sales may have less travel and logistics costs, but the cost of technological maintenance is much higher. For SMBs, inside sales can become pretty expensive.
It is difficult to depict the future of business-to-business inside sales in one sentence. The post-pandemic world is full of uncertainties, and more changes are inevitable in the global B2B sales landscape. However, you can’t ignore the fact that the pandemic has made most of us feel comfortable working remotely. This certainly opens up new doors of opportunities for the inside sales teams.
The growth of inside sales activities is further influenced by the growth in technology and tools. Sales teams worldwide are adopting different types of sales tools like customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, social selling, sales automation, and more. Hence, in the upcoming days, we can expect to see organizations adopting inside sales platforms that will help teams improve their productivity.
B2B inside sales has always been there, but the pandemic has increased its importance. As the global business landscape evolves, with hybrid work environments becoming the norm, inside sales will continue to be the dominant mode of selling. And teams need to adopt better tools and processes to thrive in this changed world.

Inside sales teams have a lot of sales acceleration tools to support them. For instance, Salesken helps B2B inside sales reps with:
AI-powered tools make the job of the inside sales reps a lot easier. They work as an instant productivity booster for the sales reps and motivate them to leverage customer data better.
On the contrary, the outside sales approach has limited technical support as the reps need to initiate physical meetings with the prospects. This could mean declining productivity and fast burn-out for the sales reps.
If you’re trying to master the art of B2B inside sales, book a demo with Salesken and find out how it can support you throughout.
Inside sales is more flexible, affordable and scalable than outside sales.
Inside sales reps manage the entire sales process remotely. The resulting location flexibility is a critical advantage. For instance, your sales team based out of Japan can close a deal with a US-based client without any excess costs.
Inside sales reps save on time spent commuting. They are 100% invested in sales activities, which helps with productivity. Overall costs are lower than outside sales, resource allocation is more optimal and the scope of conversion is higher.
As inside sales broadens the opportunities to work with a world-class sales team, scalability is a major advantage.
B2B sales funnels are already long, and you don’t want to lengthen it further with other obstacles like an onsite meeting. The post-pandemic world has become eunpredictable. There is no point in promising in-person meeting with the prospects that sales reps cannot fulfil. Alternatively, with inside sales, every funnel stage is obstacle-free, and the prospects can slide across different stages independently.
Inside sales is not all hunky-dory. If you look closely, there are some disadvantages too. Here are a few disadvantages that you should be aware of:
Inside sales is completely dependent on virtual interactions. Hence, many a time, sales reps can feel that the emotional touch is missing from their sales pitches. This may result in lesser trust dependency and can become a barrier in the path of closing a deal.
Inside sales may have less travel and logistics costs, but the cost of technological maintenance is much higher. For SMBs, inside sales can become pretty expensive.
It is difficult to depict the future of business-to-business inside sales in one sentence. The post-pandemic world is full of uncertainties, and more changes are inevitable in the global B2B sales landscape. However, you can’t ignore the fact that the pandemic has made most of us feel comfortable working remotely. This certainly opens up new doors of opportunities for the inside sales teams.
The growth of inside sales activities is further influenced by the growth in technology and tools. Sales teams worldwide are adopting different types of sales tools like customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, social selling, sales automation, and more. Hence, in the upcoming days, we can expect to see organizations adopting inside sales platforms that will help teams improve their productivity.
B2B inside sales has always been there, but the pandemic has increased its importance. As the global business landscape evolves, with hybrid work environments becoming the norm, inside sales will continue to be the dominant mode of selling. And teams need to adopt better tools and processes to thrive in this changed world.

An ideal sales strategy maximises your sales without skyrocketing your expenses. A speech- based call analytics software can assist you with that. It helps you accumulate and analyse a large volume of unstructured data to offer in-depth insights. Both sales reps and managers can learn from these and apply their learnings when formulating their future sales strategies.

Based on customer expectations and spending intents, you can generate new offers, discounts, product recommendations that will go well with your target users.
A call analytics tool like Salesken can offer rich data insights, often in real-time, on sales rep performance.

The future of B2B sales evolves with technological advancements in each organization. To be successful, they need to constantly update themselves to keep up with the changing landscape.
The Covid19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to remote and hybrid work environments have brought about a paradigm shift in the sales landscape. With 53% of professionals shifting to a remote workspace, remote selling has become the norm and face-to-face meetings a luxury. Organizations have had to adjust rapidly to this new normal and adopt suitable strategies to survive.
So what does the future of the B2B sales landscape hold? What should organizations do to thrive in this new environment?
Here are 8 biggest sales trends that will dominate the sales landscape in 2022 and beyond.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is slowly becoming the cornerstone of the B2B sales processes. McKinsey highlights that over 30% of sales tasks can be automated as of now. This percentage will only increase in the coming days. AI has a range of roles to play in B2B selling. These can include lead generation, data collection, identifying purchase patterns, and so on.
AI is critical in sales as it can predict prospects’ decisions based on their intent. A study by McKinsey shows that71%of customers expect personalized interactions from brands. Hence, sales reps need to prepare personalized sales pitches that match prospects’ needs.
With AI-based tools like Salesken, you can make it happen. This sales tool can help B2B sales teams master remote sales by identifying the customers' needs, intent and adjust the talking points accordingly. Also, with Salesken, you can provide real-time assistance to your team to adopt winning sales behaviors.
The presence of AI in B2B sales can help improve your sales process in the following ways:
Account-Based Marketing (ABM) is a marketing tactic that focuses on a set of target accounts within a particular market. The idea behind ABM is to plan and engage different accounts with personalized campaigns and messaging. The concept of ABM is getting highly popular with each passing day and is expected to improve further in 2022.
The key to making ABM a success is through proper alignment between an organization's sales and marketing teams and ensuring that both teams are aligned to common goals. As the sales and marketing teams target the same prospects and send out the same messaging, closing deals will become much easier.
Some of the core benefits of ABM are as follows:
One of the top B2B trends in 2022 is personalization. The boomers no longer define the B2B buying process. Forrester shows that 73% of millennials are actively involved in the B2B buying process. Gone are the days when buyers and sellers would be solely concerned about completing a purchase. Sales reps are now far more interested in nurturing a relationship, building trust, and adding personalization to the sales process.
Therefore, hyper-personalization is the need of the hour. Thanks to artificial intelligence, collecting and analyzing customer data can be done at scale. Therefore, one can identify the actionable insights from these datasets, decode customers’ intent and deliver hyper-personalized communication that B2B buyers cannot ignore!
To keep up with this B2B sales trend, sales teams should put their best efforts into matching prospect data with target buyer intent. As soon as there is a match, reps can start putting effort into relationship building and crafting a personalized sales pitch.
The customer is king - this is now truer than ever before. With customers being better informed, they have multiple options to choose from. To stand out and win the trust of the customer, sales teams need to adopt a customer-driven sales process. According to Gartner, 33% of buyers expect a seller-free sales experience. The sales reps should aid and facilitate the buying process, and act as a trusted friend and advisor to the customer. All they need to do is to remove all the hurdles so that customers can slide through the different stages of the B2B sales funnel.
Here’s how you can build a customer-driven sales process:
Sales enablement is the process of providing your sales team with all the necessary resources to convert more leads. It includes training, content management, best practices, research tools, and many other such resources that will enable the sales teams to sell more effectively.
Sales enablement can help your business to gain the trust of the customer and convert more leads. For an effective sales enablement strategy, organizations must:
B2B decision-makers have constantly changing needs and requirements. One cannot stick to a single channel or touchpoint to reach out to all the key decision-makers. In fact, for a broad outreach, organizations have to be present across all multiple channels at the same time. The more digital touchpoints on target, the better are your chances of reaching out to the prospects.
Omnichannel sales is the best way to enhance customer experience and reach out to them over multiple channels. Omnichannel sales is about being present in multiple digital touchpoints at once and offering customers a smooth experience.
Here are a few quick tips to master omnichannel sales:
Salesforce reveals that it is only 34% of their working hours. For the rest, B2B sales reps are busy with other time-consuming and repetitive activities like data entry, responding to emails, and other administrative tasks.
Digital tools can easily automate these non-sales activities and ensure that the reps are concentrating entirely on sales outreach, sales calls, lead generation, and closing the sales deals.
However, remember that automation is not an alternative to personalization. Sales representatives need to strike a balance between smart automation and insightful personalization to pursue the prospects.
Videos have become a critical sales touchpoint, and 87% of marketers and sellers are already making the most of it. Here are a few tips to accelerate the sales process with videos:
The above trends emphasize a single point - Personalize, Personalize and Personalize. Organizations must provide their buyers with a more personalized buying experience and the key to achieving that would be to leverage customer data. A great way to achieve that is by getting a call analytics software like Salesken. It can help you with:

Digital sales have become the biggest revolution when it comes to B2B sales. Prior to the pandemic, B2B selling was all about traditional, face-to-face interaction. The major components of B2B sales at that time were:
B2B sales process tends to be long due to the involvement of multiple decision-makers. Earlier, the B2B selling cycle used to be longer, with various physical touchpoints and of word-of-mouth referrals.
B2B sales cycles continue to be long even now. However, the physical touchpoints have shifted to digital touchpoints. As a result, digital sales are dominating the B2B sector worldwide.
For some businesses, this digital shift has been simpler since they already had a digital presence in the form of websites and social media. However, many companies had to start from square one and build their digital presence from scratch. To keep up with the biggest business-to-business sales trend, these organizations need to learn and implement various components of digital presence.

Earlier, the B2B selling cycle used to be longer, with various physical touchpoints and of word-of-mouth referrals. B2B sales cycles continue to be long even now. However, the physical touchpoints have shifted to digital touchpoints. As a result, digital sales are dominating the B2B sector worldwide. For some businesses, this digital shift has been simpler since they already had a digital presence in the form of websites and social media. However, many companies had to start from square one and build their digital presence from scratch. To keep up with the biggest business-to-business sales trend, these organizations need to learn and implement various components of digital presence." } } } </script>

The future of B2B sales evolves with technological advancements in each organization. To be successful, they need to constantly update themselves to keep up with the changing landscape.
The Covid19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to remote and hybrid work environments have brought about a paradigm shift in the sales landscape. With 53% of professionals shifting to a remote workspace, remote selling has become the norm and face-to-face meetings a luxury. Organizations have had to adjust rapidly to this new normal and adopt suitable strategies to survive.
So what does the future of the B2B sales landscape hold? What should organizations do to thrive in this new environment?
Here are 8 biggest sales trends that will dominate the sales landscape in 2022 and beyond.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is slowly becoming the cornerstone of the B2B sales processes. McKinsey highlights that over 30% of sales tasks can be automated as of now. This percentage will only increase in the coming days. AI has a range of roles to play in B2B selling. These can include lead generation, data collection, identifying purchase patterns, and so on.
AI is critical in sales as it can predict prospects’ decisions based on their intent. A study by McKinsey shows that71%of customers expect personalized interactions from brands. Hence, sales reps need to prepare personalized sales pitches that match prospects’ needs.
With AI-based tools like Salesken, you can make it happen. This sales tool can help B2B sales teams master remote sales by identifying the customers' needs, intent and adjust the talking points accordingly. Also, with Salesken, you can provide real-time assistance to your team to adopt winning sales behaviors.
The presence of AI in B2B sales can help improve your sales process in the following ways:
Account-Based Marketing (ABM) is a marketing tactic that focuses on a set of target accounts within a particular market. The idea behind ABM is to plan and engage different accounts with personalized campaigns and messaging. The concept of ABM is getting highly popular with each passing day and is expected to improve further in 2022.
The key to making ABM a success is through proper alignment between an organization's sales and marketing teams and ensuring that both teams are aligned to common goals. As the sales and marketing teams target the same prospects and send out the same messaging, closing deals will become much easier.
Some of the core benefits of ABM are as follows:
One of the top B2B trends in 2022 is personalization. The boomers no longer define the B2B buying process. Forrester shows that 73% of millennials are actively involved in the B2B buying process. Gone are the days when buyers and sellers would be solely concerned about completing a purchase. Sales reps are now far more interested in nurturing a relationship, building trust, and adding personalization to the sales process.
Therefore, hyper-personalization is the need of the hour. Thanks to artificial intelligence, collecting and analyzing customer data can be done at scale. Therefore, one can identify the actionable insights from these datasets, decode customers’ intent and deliver hyper-personalized communication that B2B buyers cannot ignore!
To keep up with this B2B sales trend, sales teams should put their best efforts into matching prospect data with target buyer intent. As soon as there is a match, reps can start putting effort into relationship building and crafting a personalized sales pitch.
The customer is king - this is now truer than ever before. With customers being better informed, they have multiple options to choose from. To stand out and win the trust of the customer, sales teams need to adopt a customer-driven sales process. According to Gartner, 33% of buyers expect a seller-free sales experience. The sales reps should aid and facilitate the buying process, and act as a trusted friend and advisor to the customer. All they need to do is to remove all the hurdles so that customers can slide through the different stages of the B2B sales funnel.
Here’s how you can build a customer-driven sales process:
Sales enablement is the process of providing your sales team with all the necessary resources to convert more leads. It includes training, content management, best practices, research tools, and many other such resources that will enable the sales teams to sell more effectively.
Sales enablement can help your business to gain the trust of the customer and convert more leads. For an effective sales enablement strategy, organizations must:
B2B decision-makers have constantly changing needs and requirements. One cannot stick to a single channel or touchpoint to reach out to all the key decision-makers. In fact, for a broad outreach, organizations have to be present across all multiple channels at the same time. The more digital touchpoints on target, the better are your chances of reaching out to the prospects.
Omnichannel sales is the best way to enhance customer experience and reach out to them over multiple channels. Omnichannel sales is about being present in multiple digital touchpoints at once and offering customers a smooth experience.
Here are a few quick tips to master omnichannel sales:
Salesforce reveals that it is only 34% of their working hours. For the rest, B2B sales reps are busy with other time-consuming and repetitive activities like data entry, responding to emails, and other administrative tasks.
Digital tools can easily automate these non-sales activities and ensure that the reps are concentrating entirely on sales outreach, sales calls, lead generation, and closing the sales deals.
However, remember that automation is not an alternative to personalization. Sales representatives need to strike a balance between smart automation and insightful personalization to pursue the prospects.
Videos have become a critical sales touchpoint, and 87% of marketers and sellers are already making the most of it. Here are a few tips to accelerate the sales process with videos:
The above trends emphasize a single point - Personalize, Personalize and Personalize. Organizations must provide their buyers with a more personalized buying experience and the key to achieving that would be to leverage customer data. A great way to achieve that is by getting a call analytics software like Salesken. It can help you with:

Digital sales have become the biggest revolution when it comes to B2B sales. Prior to the pandemic, B2B selling was all about traditional, face-to-face interaction. The major components of B2B sales at that time were:

However, many companies had to start from square one and build their digital presence from scratch.

If you’re a sales professional, you’re already aware of the importance of SMART sales goals. Setting the right sales goals is imperative to assess your performance. In this article, we’ll pinpoint some in-depth discussion on setting SMART sales goals along with a set of valuable examples.
So, let’s dive in.
Simply put, sales goals are a set of objectives that you set for your sales team. Sales professionals set these sales goals to align with an organization’s business objectives and some useful KPIs. Here’s an example of a typical sales goal:
💡 To reduce the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by 10% while the lead conversion rate stays fixed at 20%.
Ensure that the sales goals you’re setting are aligned with your company’s long-term vision. Once you finalize these goals, it is time to communicate them to your sales team.
Goal setting does matter for your sales team. Here’s why: ● If you set the goals at the beginning of a period and set a completion timeframe, that will make the sales reps accountable. ● Goals can drive motivation for your sales team to perform better. ● Sales goals can increase the productivity of your sales reps and result in higher sales. ● Last but not the least, sales goals can help you measure the performance of your sales team in an unbiased manner.
There are two types of smart sales goals that you can set for your sales team. Find out more below:
Activity-based sales goals are helpful for improving any particular tactic in your sales team.
They can drive your sales team to do better. When you set specific action-based goals for the sales reps, they know exactly what they need to accomplish. Hence, it becomes easier for them to work toward fulfilling those goals. Here is an example of an activity-based goal: Make 5 cold calls a week to 5 new prospects When you set this goal for your sales reps, you’re not pressurizing them to convert all these prospects within a week. You’re just asking them to do this activity. If they end up converting some prospects, that would be good. There are good chances of driving effective results from activity-based goals.
These types of sales goals are results-driven. Here, you’ll need to allocate certain metrics for your sales reps and usually set a specific number or target that they need to achieve to fulfill these sales goals. An example of a result-oriented sales goal is as follows:
💡 Maintain a monthly lead conversion goal of 20%.
Here, you’re just telling your prospects what they need to achieve each month. You’re not really telling them how. Now, this could be stressful for some sales reps, but others actually enjoy result-oriented goals as they’re motivated by competition.
The sales goals you set for your sales team have to be SMART. By SMART we mean Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely. Let’s get into more detail:
Sales teams often make the mistake of setting vague and generic goals that are not specific.
For example, suppose a football match is going on and you’re the coach. What is a specific goal you could set for your team? Score more goals or Score 2 goals?
The second one sounds clearer, doesn’t it? The second goal has a concrete number and it will help the players in your team understand your expectations.
Similarly, you can ask them to generate 5 leads every week when it comes to your sales team. Don’t set a vague goal like generating as many leads as possible. That will only create confusion for the reps.
When you’re setting a smart sales goal, you’re planning to evaluate whether or not you can fulfill that goal. So, your goals have to be measurable so that you can evaluate them later. That means you need a quantitative goal.
The above example of a football match holds good here. Think of a goal like this - Score 2 goals in one hour. When you’re setting this goal for your football team, you are creating a chance for your team to measure their performance after one hour. You can measure whether or not the team has successfully scored 2 goals within one hour.
The goal you’re setting for your sales reps has to be attainable. For example, you can tell your football team to score 4 goals in 90 minutes. That’s attainable. You can ask them to score 7 goals in 90 minutes, that’s difficult but still attainable. But is it possible to score more than 10 goals within 90 minutes? Usually, not attainable.
So, if you really want your sales team to achieve these goals, make them attainable.
Similar to attainable, make sure that your sales goals are realistic. You can’t just overwhelm your sales reps with tons of impractical sales goals that are not doable for a human being. Realize that growth takes time and it won’t happen just like that. Stay practical and set rational goals.
Many times, we fail to differentiate between realistic and unrealistic goals. For example, you can ask the same football team to score 15 goals in 90 minutes. That’s theoretically feasible if you consider that the team will take 6 minutes to score each goal. But that doesn’t mean it’s practically possible. What about the opponent? If the opponent is a strong competitor, scoring ⅔ goals can be a challenge.
If you want to raise the bar, instead of setting an unrealistic goal, set one attainable and realistic goal and then set another optional goal, known as a “stretch goal” or a “reach goal.” The stretch or reach the goal is one that is not unattainable or unrealistic but requires them to push themselves a bit further and overcome their current limitations to achieve. This is not a compulsory goal, but a good-to-have, that will encourage them to try harder without the pressure of failing. Overall, the key is to, set sales goals that are logical and based on the skills and potential of your sales team.
Finally, for each sales goal you set, there has to be a time frame associated with it, within which to fulfill the goal. For example, if you ask your football team to score 5 goals and skip the time part, will that sound feasible? They don’t have a lifetime to score those 5 goals, so you’ll need to mention 5 goals within 90 minutes.
Setting a deadline for each goal is essential to keep everyone on track and create a sense of urgency to achieve the goal.
Here are a few SMART sales goals that you can include in your SMART sales plan:
Goal 1: Increase revenue by X% Goal 2: Reduce churn rate by X% Goal 3: Increase win rates Goal 4: Reduce the length of sales cycles Goal 5: Increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Goal 6: Reduce attrition Goal 7: Target the number of cold calls made, emails sent and demos booked
Why does it matter?
The first SMART sales goal that you can set is increasing your sales revenue. It is one of the most common sales goals examples. By revenue, we mean the sales revenue that your sales team can earn by selling various products and services. This goal matters for the overall business growth of your organization. Also, this sales goal is pretty easy to explain and grasp.
Here is an example of this sales goal:
Increase sales revenue for next quarter by 10%.
What strategy should you adopt? ● Set well-defined and achievable SMART sales goals ● Try to build a stronger communication network with prospects and customers ● Focus more on upselling and cross-selling ● Try to evolve your existing sales processes constantly ● Educate and train your sales reps Know how Conversation Intelligence can help increase the sales team's revenue.
Why does it matter?
‍The churn rate is the number of customers who leave your organization in a stipulated time frame, which detects how efficiently you’re retaining your customers. Churn rate is a critical factor for every organization. Did you know that organizations lose $1.6 trillion per year due to customer churn? Hence, it would help if you focused on this particular sales goal to ensure that you’re retaining your existing customers. Remember that retaining customers is an important revenue driver for your organization.
What strategy should you adopt?
● Learn the reasons for your churn through thorough customer engagement ● Find out the most valuable customers and focus on their requirements ● Try to target the appropriate audience groups ● Keep offering discounts, loyalty bonuses, etc. to your customers Try Salesken’s Objection Break-Up feature to get more visibility into your top customers’ expectations and requirements, so that you can address their concerns on a regular basis. ‍
Why does it matter? One of the mandatory SMART sales goals can be increasing your win rates. The purpose of estimating sales win rate is to understand which sales reps are more likely to convert prospects into customers. You can calculate the sales win rate with the following formula:
💡 Sales win rate = [ Final stage prospects who got converted into customers / Total numbers of sales deals in the pipeline]
The sales win rate helps you determine how fast you’re converting more prospects and who your top-performing sales reps are.
What strategy should you adopt?‍
● Use a sales win rate calculator to stay updated about the numbers of prospects closed ● Set your win/loss criteria on the basis of price, competition, timing, and any other relevant factor ● Don’t rely on assumptions;, use a sales intelligence tool to opt for a data-driven approach Salesken can help you find the most valuable prospects having high intent to purchase your products. Hence, you can put more effort into converting these prospects and fulfilling this SMART sales goal.
Why does it matter?
The sales cycle should be an integral part of your SMART sales plan. It helps you estimate the time your sales team takes to convert a lead into a customer. The shorter the sales cycle, the higher are the chances of increasing your sales revenue.
A small sales tip here - For some business sectors, a longer sales cycle is standard. In those cases, it is wiser to focus on optimizing your sales cycle instead of shortening it.
What strategy should you adopt? ‍
● Focus on automation and remove any repetitive tasks from your current sales cycle ● Focus on training your sales reps with the latest tools and tactics ● Discover your high-performing sales channels and stick to them ● Stay clear about pricing your services from the very first stage
Use Salesken’s Good Call Engine to remove assumptions from your sales pitches, find words that can create maximum influence on your prospects, and create a buyer profile that perfectly matches your offerings.
Why does it matter? ‍
Customer lifetime value helps you understand the net profit you can make from a customer over time.
Here’s a quick example.
Suppose, you are selling subscriptions for an OTT platform. You convert a prospect who subscribes for your basic plan that’s worth $10. After a year, this prospect upgrades to the pro plan that’s worth $15. So, if the prospect stays for another 2 years with your company, their total CLV will be $300.
Hence, if you adopt the proper SMART sales strategies, you can increase your CLV over time. This can also mean higher sales revenue and lower churn.
What strategy should you adopt?
● Use a conversation intelligence tool to build a data-driven overview of your customers’ needs, expectations likes, and dislikes ● Automate customer onboarding process to enhance overall productivity ● Focus on identifying and improving the talk patterns of your sales reps to increase the chances of upselling and cross-selling opportunities ● Collect actionable feedback from customers to improve your offerings ‍
Why does it matter?
It should be a priority of any sales team to reduce their overall sales attrition rate as much as possible. Losing an expert sales rep can cause irreparable damages for your team with long-term impacts on your overall sales revenue. A common reason behind high attrition is that sales reps don’t get targeted feedback from their managers and fail to identify growth opportunities. Sales managers should make it a point to help the sales reps with proper coaching to evolve and learn new sales tactics.
● Invest in coaching your sales reps ● Arrange 1:1 discussion sessions between sales managers and sales reps to provide them with actionable feedback ● Conduct exit interviews to find out what caused the attrition and find out ways to fix them Salesken is a top-notch sales enablement software that can coach your reps, help them understand the dos and don'ts of their sales pitches, train them on managing sales conversations, handling objections, and so on. You can use this software to find out your top-performing reps and build a more efficient SMART sales strategy.
Some of the major activities that are imperative for any sales team are the number of cold calls made, cold emails sent and the overall demo sessions booked in a particular time period. Sales managers should keep track of all these activities. They need to set activity-based SMART sales goals in such a way that reps focus on these activities on a continuous basis.
Salesken’s Voice of Customer can help you gain more insights into your customers’ personal profiles and help you find out their needs and concerns, so you can align your cold emailing and cold calling strategies with customers’ pain points and improve conversations.
Before wrapping up, we just want to give a small suggestion. Don’t start with big goals as it can get overwhelming. Instead, break down your SMART smart sales goals into a number of small goals and allocate relevant time frames to accomplish them. That way, the goals will remain achievable and you can track your progress. Keep practicing this habit to stay motivated and accountable.

Cold calling is hard indeed as it involves several variables and takes up a lot of your time and still doesn’t guarantee conversion.
But is it necessary?
Well, yes. For 69% of buyers, cold calls are a convincing way to explore purchase decisions. So, if you’re not taking cold calling seriously, you’re missing out on several valuable opportunities.
We have compiled 15 COLD CALLING SCRIPTS for you in this article to power up your cold calling game. So, without further ado, let’s get started.
Here’s one of the basic cold calling scripts that you can start with:‍
Hi (Prospect’s name), I want to keep it short as I know you’re a busy person. I have called to inform you that we specialize in (Mention your specialization) and we can help you with (Mention the best features of your product/service). If you have the time, I would like to ask you some questions. This is to find out if our product can benefit you in any way. Would you be comfortable answering these questions If the prospect asks you to go ahead, you need to ask a set of interesting questions as follows:

The purpose of this call script is to collect more and more relevant information from your prospects. Don’t expect to achieve conversion with this sales script. Also, please personalize this script based on your organization’s offerings and your target prospects’ requirements.
Lucky are those sales reps, who can make their very first sales call to the decision-makers. In most cases, you’ve to spend a lot of time with gatekeepers before you can reach your actual prospect. No worries. We’re here with a call script that can help you get through the gatekeeper. Here it is:
Hi (Gatekeeper's name), I am (your name) and I was wondering if I could ask for a favour from you. I am looking for (Prospect's / decision-makers name) who is in charge of X department. Can you tell me how I can make that happen?
Note: If you don’t know the gatekeeper’s name yet, make sure you ask that first.
Selling your product doesn’t happen that easily. It takes time. So, don’t ask your prospect to purchase from you in the very first interaction. Instead, ask them to book a demo call. Remember, you want to win their trust first.
Here’s a cold calling sales script to help you out:
Hi (Prospect's name), This is (your name) from (your company's name). I have recently come across your organization. I found out that it is one of the fastest-growing enterprises in the (prospect's industry name) sector. I hope this is a good time to talk? I promise to keep it short. Many of our existing customers belong to (prospect's industry name) and they've successfully achieved growth in (your expertise) with (name of the product/service you want to pitch). Does that sound interesting to you? Why don't we schedule a quick demo call next week to explain our product and how it can benefit your organization in terms of time and money? I'm free on Monday and Tuesday next week. Does that work for you
You can’t expect that all your calls will get received. Sales reps know it pretty well that many of their calls go straight to voicemail. So, how about a call script for all those voicemails? Here you go:
Hello (Prospect's name), This is (your name) from (your organization's name). I am calling to discuss our product (product name) with you, and how it can help you with the current challenge (the challenge they're facing). I wanted to get in a quick call with you to explore this further. You can reach me at - (your contact number). Thanks.
This call script is more like a cold outreach that tells your prospect what they should do next to reach you. But again, you can personalize it based on your requirements.
We know that traditionally cold calls are not exactly meant for conversion. They are more about relationship building and getting to know the prospects better. But what would you do if you had only one chance at converting a prospect?
In that case, you’ll need to create one of the value-packed cold calling scripts that can impress the prospect at the very first attempt. Also, make sure that you are completely aware of the prospect’s problems. Since you’ve only one shot at conversion, you cannot risk losing it. Here’s a call script to help you out:
Hi (Prospect's name), do you have a minute?
If the prospect says “Yes”,
That's great! I am sure you're a busy professional and I completely respect the value of your time. However, I came to know that your organization (Mention organization's name) is passing through a critical challenge (mention the challenge). If my research is correct, your clients are also unhappy due to this. Am I correct?
The prospect says, “Yes, partly correct, but..”
Now you need to listen to the prospect and ask contextual, relevant questions to better understand the challenge. Once you do, reply:
I understand. (Your organization's name) can help you with (mention your services that can solve the prospect's challenge. Don't describe anything generic here. Stay specific). We have also helped (mention some competitor brads and how you helped them) with this same problem. Now they've successfully overcome this challenge and have achieved (mention some results).
This discussion can go further. If everything goes well, you can convert a new lead right in the call.
Are you trying to establish a trusted authority through your journey? Here’s how you can tell your story to hook the prospect:
Hi (prospect’s name), I’m (your name) from (your company’s name). It is my mission to help one organization every day in its digital transformation process. I believe I can help you find a solution to (the problem a prospect is facing). Do you want to explore this further?
This type of call script can help you gain your prospect’s trust and also grow their interest in your journey.
Positioning yourself as a salesperson may not always work with the prospects. Want to make a difference? Start placing yourself as a networking champ. Here’s a call script for that:
Hi (prospect’s name), I’m (your name) from (your company’s name). I have been working in the (industry name) for over five years now. Some of our clients in this industry believe in our services include (name some of your clients who are also the competitors of the prospect). We have helped them with (some of the critical challenges for the stated industry). I was wondering if I could set up an introductory call to know your business better and discuss how we can help you.
Does that sound right?
This call script may not help you convert many leads at first but it can surely help you with the networking.
Here is a brief sales call script that can generate an immediate response from your prospects:
Hi, this is (your name) from (your organization’s name). Are you currently looking for a solution to (some challenge the prospect is facing)? Our company can help you out with that. Would you like to discuss this further?
You’re very likely to get a quick response against this sales call script. However, the response can be either “Yes” or “No”. So be prepared accordingly.
In the case of SaaS prospecting, a personalized one-liner value statement goes a long way. In fact, if you start conveying only relevant, brief information to your SaaS prospects instead of overwhelming them with tons of features, your chances of conversion can increase.
Here’s who what we’re referring to:
Hi (Prospect’s name), this is (your name) from (company name). I was wondering if you would like to know about a sales intelligence tool that can help you detect your prospects’ intent and coach your sales reps with the most compelling lead conversion hacks. Is this something that interests you?
‍Here we have discussed the value proposition of our product. Of course, you can personalize this based on your product’s specifications.
Cold calling is not always about acquiring new customers or generating leads. Sometimes, you may need a call script to generate referrals from your customers. We have a call script that can help you with that:
Hi (Prospect’s name), I noticed that (mention some of their recent activity that proves their loyalty to your brand. This could be a purchase or regularly sharing your content on social media). I was wondering if you could do me a favour. Do you know anyone in the (industry name) seeking to achieve great results through our solution? We’ll offer your friend an extended trial period of 3 months. Also, as a token of appreciation, we’ll offer you an X% discount on your monthly subscription amount for each friend you refer. Can you think of anyone who can make great use of our solutions?
You can add more personalized offers to this cold calling script to seek the attention of your customers.
Note: You should only call your best customers for this offer. Here’s how you can find them out:
Identify these customers and try to convert them into loyal customers with suitable offers and discounts.
Suppose your goal from the cold call is to build a rapport with the prospect. Below are some tips that you must include within your sales calling script:
These are the imperative elements of a cold calling script for software sales or SaaS prospecting. Based on the prospect’s response and interest, you can discuss further.
Prospects don’t always reply. Mostly because they’re genuinely busy and they forget to respond back to your cold calls. Here’s a call script that is perfect for following up:
Hi (prospect’s name), I’m calling back as discussed. I hope this is a good time. Did you get a chance to check my email yet?
If the prospect says, “Yes”,
Great! As mentioned in my email, our (mention your products/services again)can help you generate (potential results).
‍This is a quick call to see if we can help you in any way. Do you mind if I ask you some questions to get clarity over your needs?
This call script is partly a discovery call and partly a follow-up. Your motive should be to adapt to your prospect’s schedule so that you can begin or resume the sales call.
If you didn’t get a call-back from the prospect, this sales call script could be apt to follow up the prospect via voice mail:
Hi (prospect’s name), I had left you a voice message last week regarding our product (product’s name) and was expecting to find a good time to discuss this further. I just wanted to remind you that we (a one-liner value proposition). I was wondering if I could show you how we generate ( potential results). Are you interested in scheduling a call to discuss this further?
What if you get a straight objection from your prospect? Here’s a cold call sales script to help you in this situation: ‍
“I get it that this is not on your priority list right now. But we would still list to request you to have a brief discussion with us. This can help you learn more about our product and you can assess your requirements effectively. I would request you to give me five minutes of your time to discuss this further.”
‍But remember, if the prospect’s answer is still “No”, don’t push them further.
Ever considered using a personalized opening statement for your cold calls? Here’s an example of such an opening statement:
A friend of mine is an alumnus of (prospect’s university name). I have visited the campus a few times and loved it. In which year did you graduate from there?
Now, the prospect may or may not open up in response to this. But if they do, don’t hesitate to keep the conversation going.
Are you looking for a perfect sales enablement tool that can coach your sales reps, help them with dos and don’ts and come up with personalized cold calling strategies for your reps?

Sales teams usually put great efforts towards closing deals of all sizes. Effective sales discovery process plays a crucial role in closing. Different leads have different expectations, and sales discovery questions have to be aligned with the lead’s requirements. We’ve come up with a few best sales discovery questions to help sales teams understand how discovery questions can be in line with the requirements of any lead
The sales discovery call is a sales rep’s very first call with a prospect. This call has critical significance in the sales process since it helps in building a long-lasting relationship and also in qualifying or disqualifying a prospect. So, it is essential to not make any mistakes during these sales calls.
A sales discovery call can help enterprises recognize the pain points of their prospects to qualify/disqualify them. They think that sales discovery calls are pretty simple. All that the sales reps do is do a bit of background research, evaluate the prospects' website and LinkedIn profiles, and move ahead.
But in reality, sales discovery call is a multi-stage process. So, if you approach such a call with a discovery call script and prepare a set of relevant customer discovery questions, your chances of qualifying a lead are much better.
The same sales discovery process doesn’t work for both B2B and B2C customers. When the target customers are different, discovery call questions are also different. We have tried to set up some context to understand the difference in detail.
When you’re targeting a B2B prospect, conducting in-depth research is a must. Apart from your prospect’s official website, do look into their social media profiles, to understand their messaging, their target customers, positioning, their social footprint, and so on.
The best kind of research is when you’re completely aware of your prospect’s background. During the discovery call, you won’t have any new questions to ask regarding their offerings. If the prospect realizes that you’ve researched them before getting into a discovery call, it would be an instant trust booster for them.
The next challenge in a sales discovery call is to understand your prospects’ pain points. Know that businesses are not always aware of their pain points. So, you need to prepare a set of good customer discovery questions to guide them during this process.
If you can help them identify their pain points and offer solutions for the same, nothing like it. This step is very important during any sales discovery call.
Now that you know the prospects’ pain points and have their attention, you need to remain as optimistic as possible. You need to make them feel that you have a solution for their pain points. Helping them with an optimistic approach can go a long way.
Start describing your solutions and how they could benefit the prospects. Explain to them that these products and solutions can effectively help businesses to fulfil their goals. Also, don’t forget to mention the cost-benefit perspective. If your prospects believe that your solutions can help them gain maximum at minimum investment, the deal is most likely yours.
Before hanging up, you need to offer some next-step recommendations to the prospects. This could be anything like signing up for a free demo and following up with emails. Also, don’t forget to thank the prospect for their valuable time, before concluding the discovery call.
When you’re approaching a customer for the first time, you need to have enough information about them. Doing your homework is always mandatory to conduct a successful sales discovery call. To understand a customer and their perspective, you have to go through several platforms.
You can check a target customer’s social media profiles like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. to understand who they follow, what interests them, and so on. In some cases, tracking a customer through different review portals can also help you understand their experiences with different competitors’ products and the gap you need to fill.
If you stay enthusiastic during your sales discovery call, you can easily close many sales deals. Try to maintain a positive attitude so that you sound believable and they can trust you with their problems.
It is very important to build your rapport with the customer during the first call. Start with project discovery phase questions like where they went to school, where they grew up, and so on. Once the prospect starts opening up to you, go on to ask more specific questions.
This strategy works a lot for B2C sales discovery calls as it builds a trust factor.
Sales reps often make the mistake of asking too many questions without listening to the prospect’s answers. Active listening skill is a very essential quality for any sales rep. Make sure that you’re asking the right questions, listening to the prospects’ answers, and noting down useful pointers. Ideally, the sales reps should talk during 45% of the discovery call duration. The more you listen to them, the better are your chances for gaining their trust.
Create a discovery call script or template and stick to it throughout the call. This script should include all the questions that you’re expected to ask during a discovery call. These questions are mostly based on your research on a prospect and sticking to these questions can help you drive better results. In some companies, the senior sales reps create a discovery call-template so that the new joiners can follow the same template and modify the questions based on the prospects.
Listed below are 30 sales discovery questions that can help your sales reps close the deals faster.
Planning to prepare your discovery call script? Don’t forget to add these questions:
You should start your discovery call with some easy introductory questions. These are helpful to break the ice with your prospect for the first time and build a great relationship with them. Here are a few:
Now that you have the basic information about your prospect, move on to the next set of questions to understand their pain points. Here’re a few questions through which you can understand the pain points of your customers:
It is always better to understand the red flags in advance. These can later stop a deal from qualifying. So ask these questions and make sure that you and your prospect are on the same page.
Can you amplify the pain points for your prospects? Use these project discovery phase questions to make the prospects realize what they’re missing out on:
Now that it is clear from the prospect that the problem is pretty big, you need to help them with proper solutions as the next step. Below are some questions to start with:

Growth is one of the key agenda of all business leaders, and regardless of the size of the company, it's safe to assume that your business strategy works around growing your revenue.
There are a myriad of ways to grow your business and it may follow several directions too, but before you do, building a growth strategy is vital, one that will not just facilitate success but also helps you scale your operations and keep your employees productive.
At the center of this strategy should be technology, as you guessed it right.
In the modern business world, digital transformation is one of the driving forces behind long-term success and growth.
Sales technology is evolving just as fast as mar-tech is, and for the right reasons.
Sales technology has the ability to revamp your sales process by supporting your sales teams in generating more leads, fueling more insightful sales conversion tactics, and getting prospects to convert.
Salespeople can make use of sales technology to build a killer sales pipeline, enhance responsiveness, establish long-term relationships with customers and prospects, and ultimately, accelerate their sales by nurturing and converting leads.
But, before we dive in, what exactly is sales technology and why should a sales organization leverage it?
In this blog, we'll discuss -
Let's begin.
Today, although sales technology might be confused with software sales, especially that of SaaS products, there's more to it than just that.
Sales automation, sales enablement, and sales technology have evolved tremendously over the last few years. But, what is sales technology, and how is it different from sales automation and sales enablement?
Sales technology is defined as a set of tools that help improve and enhance sales productivity by enabling salespeople to leverage their time and customer intelligence effectively and efficiently.
Sales automation, on the other hand, is a subgroup of sales technology, which helps most salespeople automate their mundane tasks for higher productivity and optimal use of the sales rep's time.
Customer relationship management software is a leading example of sales automation.
On the contrary, sales enablement is also a subdivision of sales techniques that is used far and wide by sales and marketing teams across all organizations. Sales enablement is typically used to produce better and more relevant content to help prospects and customers throughout their journey seamlessly.
Sales enablement is often described as the process and tools that enable the sales and marketing team to produce the right kind of content at the right time to engage and nurture potential customers accordingly.
Sales technology has been growing steadily over the last few years - the number of tools, categories, and users.
AI, automation, machine learning, NLP, and more can revolutionize sales tasks that often go unnoticed by salespeople such as finding and sorting out leads, chatting with potential customers via chatbots, and closing sales deals.
Modern technology for sales and marketing are rapidly evolving, and this fact is ubiquitous.
We now have deeper, better insights into customer data, which can be used to provide personalized services catered to our customers' respective stages in the sales process.
Sales and technology complement one another flawlessly. With technology, sales leaders can improve overall productivity to a great extent, provide value to the business, manage raw data seamlessly, and find leads in this competitive environment.
Without a doubt, a great sales team can bring in tons of revenue to the business. However, to facilitate this, salespeople need to manage their time effectively to focus on making a sale, and not on routine tasks.
With sales technology, this is possible.
Investing and upgrading your business with sales technology, is really, investing in yourself.
It pays off in the long-term and can improve the overall health of your business, aka, revenue engine.
Modern technology has equipped us with new, novice ways to find quality leads that match your ideal customer profile.
With sales technology, here are some ways sales leaders can hunt leads that weren't available a decade ago -
More importantly, these sales tools leverage advanced technologies to aid sales professionals with the best route, personalize their method, and perform their best.
We can all agree that personalization and strategic sales processes can have a profound effect on the company's profits and customer lifetime value.
Switching to sales technology does not mean that the job of a salesperson is moot, or could extinguish. The role of a salesperson is equally, if not more, important to an organization.
Traditional sales have transformed into data-based interactions that leverage technology, to further support salespeople to perform their best and make their lives easier.
Having said that, as an organization, what kind of technology should you leverage to increase sales?
Modern sales teams leverage technology to drive higher revenue. From automating admin tasks, gathering customer insights to providing personalized, sales tech plays a major role in providing teams with an edge.
Here are 8 technologies that you can leverage to ensure your teams ace their goals -
A CRM is typically the first buy for any sales team.
It acts as a database of all your leads - right from the time they enter the funnel, till they are handed over to the customer success or support teams.
They provide insights on where the leads get stuck, and help you optimize those stages and improve outcomes.
The CRMs, when integrated with marketing automation software's and/or customer support software, can provide sales teams with insights on the customer as they go through all touchpoints. Teams can now identify which marketing campaigns generate maximum leads, and tailor the pitch and messaging accordingly to ensure maximum success.
Lead enrichment involves activities that sales teams do to get all relevant details of the lead - contact details, roles, and other relevant details that can help teams qualify and nurture only relevant leads.
Lead enrichment tools help teams to understand their audience better, and help create personalized experiences that can improve outcomes.
And lead enrichment tools automate the entire process to help sales teams identify quality leads.
Sales teams spend a considerable amount of time prospecting and qualifying leads, and lead enrichment tools can help automate the entire process to ensure teams spend more time in selling.
Although not all of the sales tools are directly tied to customer interactions, tools that aid internal teams' to flourish and maintain consistent communication are vital.
This is especially true given the new normal and the rise of remote sales teams.
Ideally, sales reps must be able to share resources, connect with each other without any hassle, and perform other internal tasks to move forward with a deal. Likewise, sales managers should have visibility into their team's performance and collaboration.
Having a communication tool will do the trick.
Tools such as Slack, Zoom, Trello, and Notion are adopted by sales teams across the globe to streamline internal communication and minimize back-and-forth's.
In addition to celebrating small wins and keeping the team up to date with company news, these tools are perfect to collaborate with folks from other departments too.
Sales teams should be able to communicate with one another asynchronously to improve connection, reduce lag times between responses, and contribute to a more productive work environment.
Sales automation tools can assist and simplify an enormous chunk of their workload on a daily basis.
The right automation tool can make generating and qualifying leads extremely easy. Every time a prospect enters the sales funnel, automation tools help the sales team engage leads and prospects with personalized content.
A CRM is an example of sales automation. With the right CRM, sales teams can leverage their several templates to write a personalized email based on triggers and nurture flows to drive them toward becoming a customer.
Automation tools such as Zapier lets you integrate hundreds of apps with one another in several ways to automate most functions.
Sales automation tools take the load off your sales reps' platter and can also act as an extra member of the team by engaging and closing leads.
Sales enablement tools are software applications or platforms that are designed to help sales teams be more effective in their roles. These tools can provide a range of features and functionality, such as document management, sales training and coaching, sales analytics and reporting, content creation and management, and customer relationship management (CRM). The goal of sales enablement tools is to improve the efficiency and productivity of sales teams, and to help them close more deals by providing them with the resources and information they need to succeed. Some examples of sales enablement tools include Salesforce, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Seismic.
What do your customers prefer - calls or emails?
And when is it “too soon” and when is it “too late” to contact a prospect? And are you pushing the leads too hard?
This where sales enablement and engagement tools can help you.
Sales enablement and engagement tools enable one to uncover key details about the lead, when to engage them, and the content that can create maximum engagement.
For instance, Salesken can help you gain insights about the customers, know their key concerns, and needs, and help you create nurturing strategies that will resonate best with the customers, improve engagement and outcomes.
Also, Salesken can help you identify the winning strategies of your top reps, and share them in real-time with the entire team. This improves sales teams’ productivity, and helps in reaching their revenue targets.
Sales scheduling tools enable companies an easy and efficient way to schedule meetings with prospects and customers.
We're all aware of the pressure of closing deals and how managers are always up to sales teams' necks to speed up their process.
The takeaway?
Identify sales opportunities for companies to close deals faster. This is possible with sales scheduling tools.
Modern sales tools help you assess who your hot leads are, and the best strategies to nurture them. A scheduler helps automate the routing process, and companies can now guide the leads to the qualified reps who are best suited to engage them and improve conversions.
Calendly is one such tool that helps lead schedule slots with your sales team directly without any hassle of a middleman. They can access your sales reps’ calendar directly, see your available slots, and book a meeting.
Easy peasy!
Another example of sales scheduling is chatbots to engage and re-route your customers on your behalf, allowing you ample time to prepare and respond accordingly.
AI tools can help automate customer engagement, answer customer queries and collect valuable information about the leads that can help sales teams know their customers better.
These tools, powered with AI and machine learning, get better at customer interactions and engage just like humans do. This will also personalize the buying experience and make your leads feel heard and valued, and improves the chances of conversions.
Social tools such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram are getting a lot of attention of late.
It's 2023, and it's the way a lot of salespeople, especially millennials enter the sales ranks.
Social media is one of the best and proven methods to increase website traffic and ultimately, sales. Internet tools have changed the rules of the game when it comes to sales, marketing, and customer expectations.
With every information available at customers' fingertips, social media has made it easier and also, complicated for sales managers. Data has always been the forefront runner in the sales process, and yet, social media made it way easier to access customer data while automation tools can facilitate the analysis of data imported, allowing you to focus on data-driven sales.
Identify key customers, their likes, interests, background, and more details needed to target them and focus on building a high-quality presence.
Salespeople can easily connect with their prospects by just following them on social media. When identifying the prospects, make use of keywords meant to search your clients active from your respective industry.
Another way to drive more sales is by turning your existing clients into your brand advocates - reach out to them and offer to promote your product in exchange for a freebie, or a discount.
Social media can increase brand visibility, and help salespeople build long-lasting relationships with prospects and customers. This can further boost your chances of driving sales from social channels.
The attention span of an average visitor to a website is short, and if they aren't engaged in a short time, they leave immediately.
This is where chatbots come into play.
It's quite impossible for a human to sit at a desk all day and respond to every inquiry that comes their way. As demand for personalization and instant communication is on the rise, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular and more sophisticated for all businesses.
Customers usually complain about chatbots providing answers in the most bot-like manner, however, modern chatbots are powered by AI and machine learning to respond to every query in a human-like language.
With customers expecting a detailed answer to their questions and complaints, as sales leaders you can train your chatbots to meet your customers' needs, thus increasing your chances to bring in more sales!
Chatbots have the ability to respond to customer queries, understand their behavior and interests, and suggest available options - and, all of this is automated.
Sales chatbots enable you to push your leads further down the funnel with little or no human interference. They're also equipped with huge benefits - cost-cutting to avoid hiring a human agent and they're always on time!
When choosing sales technology to automate sales and marketing activities across your organization, many factors are considered like price, features, integrations, and support.
Whether it be a CRM, a website, or more, you need to be sure before signing that contract.
Here are 4 primary factors to consider when choosing sales technology -
For most, privacy and security are often the deal breaker when it comes to choosing a sales tech. There's no need to waste either's time if one of the criteria doesn't meet your requirements.
It's absolutely vital to understand the privacy implications of software under any consideration.
Some of the key privacy features to look out for before considering a tool are - SOC 2 compliance, GDPR compliant, and other basic privacy settings. If this sounds like a lot of trouble, reassess the tool again.
Getting hacked is bad business and bad for public relationships. Take your time out to ensure you're sure before choosing the tool.
Most sales and marketing tools have proven to help businesses capture the right kind of leads and convert them at a lower cost, making it sound like an investment plan for your business.
However, the rise of unexpected costs can quickly cut you off your budget goals.
On the contrary, free or low-cost solutions do not always come with the support or features you need to fully utilize the tool for optimum performance. It can quickly become a hassle than it's worth when you discover that the tool won't help you out like you intended to.
It's a balancing act - prices, features, support, and ease of use are some key considerations to make before choosing the software for your business.
It is possible that certain tools can be specialized only for specific tasks. Conversational AI tools, prospecting tools, sales enablement tools and others are ones that have a specific purpose, and it can help optimize specific functions that need improvements.
But, before you pick the tool, you need to ensure that it integrates with your current tech stack to ensure seamless use of the product.
Else, you will need to spend additional time and resources to use the tool, which may outweigh the gains from using the particular technology.
Typically, all integrations are available on the website or make it a point to specifically check with the vendor if they integrate with your current tech stack.
Tools should be customizable based on your requirements and use case.
There could be a number of reasons why you want a particular feature or not.
From legal [data privacy issues] to practical [irrelevant use case], the vendors must be able to customize it as per your requirements.
And if the vendor is unable to show customization within a specific time frame, it is a red flag for you to move to other vendors or service providers.
Once your business is up and running, minor issues can glitch up your entire day. Understanding the type of support the vendor provides often prevents major headaches, in case an issue arrives.
Understand what type of support your teams are okay with - do you need phone support, or prefer live chat or email correspondence?
Is access to 24/7 support an absolute must? Or, do you prefer to get it done during business hours?
Before choosing the software, make sure to try all kinds of support and gauge their responses based on response time, frequency of replies, and the language and tone of voice used as part of your vetting process.
Once you've got your process ironed out and implemented sales and marketing tools with your business, you'll want everything to be running smoothly.
This checklist should be your top priority when choosing new sales tools. Although every company is different, and so are their operations, ultimately, you'll need to fine-tune your checklist that works for your business.
Even before COVID-19, organizations across the globe have been adopting and integrating sales technology to be at par with the buyers' behavior.
However, in the wake of the pandemic, consumer behavior changed drastically forcing businesses to adopt quicker and retrieve deeper insights into their sales data to drive maximum sales performance.
These sales insights do not suffice the current market trends to provide the best customer services and exceed their sales goals.
Here are four sales technology trends to watch out for -
Selling has changed drastically over the last few years.
With social selling, businesses across the globe can easily connect with prospects and customers from any geography with accurate targeting that would greatly benefit from your product.
A huge part of business communication happens on social media and through communication channels, let's say chatbots.
There's no other time to get on social media to get your customers to notice you than now.
Social selling improves brand visibility by actively engaging with prospects and customers online, which keeps your brand on top of their minds. This means, getting higher quality leads with high conversion rates.
Some of the key social platforms that aid businesses to meet their quotas are LinkedIn and Twitter.
Sales teams have for long tried to automate tasks so that their teams can spend more time building relationships with the customers and improve conversions.
The rise in AI technologies have made it possible for sales reps to automate much of their routine, admin tasks.
From CRM entries, note taking during calls, automated lead scoring, identifying lead intent, much of the tasks has been automated and the insights thus gathered is being leveraged by sales teams to provide a personalized buying experience for the buyers and improve conversions.
Sales automation technologies not only improve sales outcomes, but help improve employee morale and satisfaction, and reduce attrition.
With inflation at its peak since the 1980s and supply chains severely disrupted, top business leaders are worried about rising consumer costs.
As a result, CSOs across the globe are observing consumer, product, and transactions of sales data to understand how they impact consumer behavior.
By leveraging AI, dynamic pricing models are being built and adjusted in real-time across organizations all over.
With most B2B companies, pricing software can be grouped together contingent to their industry, past purchases, lenience towards a sale, and other factors to provide maximum transparency while negotiating deals.
Pricing prediction will be a critical factor in the coming years for driving peak sales performance in the wake of the rising inflation.
Even before the pandemic, most companies were, by and large, adopting digital technologies.
But, this peaked during the pandemic to drive optimum sales performance.
Consumers have started taking a digital first approach to buying, and sales teams must be able to personalize the buying experience to stand out from the competition. Teams need to adopt tools that can better understand customer needs, and provide the exact information that the customer is looking for at each stage of the funnel to ensure maximum success.
With this in mind, teams need to review their current sales processes, and add in technologies that can help optimize them to stand out from the crowd and close more deals.
The digital age is here and unless businesses recognize the value of being digital-first, we may find ourselves left behind.
A great deal of B2B companies in the recent past are well integrated with forward-thinking sales strategies, including AI-leveraged chatbots, sales automation, machine learning, and more.
Top sales professionals not only leverage sales technology to witness peak performance but also ensure that the same is used to achieve better results.

Do you spend a great deal of time looking for new leads, learn about them, craft a fantastic personalised email for them only to find out that it bounced back? If this scenario sounds extremely familiar to you as a sales rep, then you need to read on.
What if we told you that there is a way to not only know which leads are most likely to convert but also what you need to do to make that sale?
The answer is lead enrichment.
In this guide, we’ll cover what lead enrichment is, why it’s important for your sales team, and how to make it a part of your process.
Lead enrichment is the process of collecting and organising sales supportive data around your leads from your database. Verified data provides your sales team with enhanced perspective into a prospective customer.
Not having accurate data on leads can slow, if not completely, halt your efforts in closing that sale - part of the reason why bad data costs US companies a whopping $3.1 trillion each year!
The goal of lead enrichment is to create insights on how to increase the effectiveness of sales strategies to help you analyse the sales pipeline and lead generation to close deals better.
Lead enrichment gathers data such as company size, role or job description, industry, email address, and phone number; essentially, any data that helps your team enhance their outreach process.
This can be done either manually (by entering it into your system) or you can leverage software intelligence tools such as Salesken to do that work for you whenever a lead comes in.
Without verified leads, businesses will lack a valuable database of sales and customer base needed to grow exponentially.
Organisations cannot rely on intuition alone; they need established strategies and tools to attract the right kind of customers they want.
Without such a strategy, targeting the right target audience, identifying the right metrics for conversion, and analysing the sales pipeline quality becomes extremely difficult.
Here are seven advantages to switching to lead enrichment for your sales team:
If the sales rep had access to accurate lead data, the amount of time saved and, in turn, the cost of sales incurred would be much less.
Bad data is highly expensive for organisations– sales reps spending their time chasing incorrect leads is both time-consuming and expensive.
Lead enrichment tools tackle precisely this. Switching to AI-driven, smart lead enrichment tools can not only help you identify the right leads but also ramp up your e1fforts with intuitive call tracking metrics to understand where exactly you stand.
89% of marketers say that email is their primary channel for lead generation. With email marketing being the primary source for procuring leads, having an inaccurate database makes it an extremely tedious task, and having quality leads becomes a high priority.
To see this in action in your business, you need to align your B2B lead gen process and create a clear framework for the buyer with an appropriate lead enrichment tool. Key tasks include:
With automatic incoming leads from your automation tool, your sales team may find that the quality of the leads is better than relying on manual methods. As a part of your automation, follow a data-driven approach. Use only the data your tool suggests to help you prioritise leads that will convert instead of leads that are unlikely to convert.
One of the most dreaded tasks of relying on a manual database for leads is that the sales rep and the potential customer will have to fill in the information repeatedly, resulting in low retention rates. Additionally, according to sources, if the sales rep does not respond within 30 mins, the opportunity is lost. Asking for excess information to find the perfect lead only slows reps down.
With lead enrichment tools, you can ask for minimal data such as their name, company, and the role and then discover the rest of the data to help you target them and have a conversation with them.
In this way, lead enrichment helps reduce lead abandonment, produce more relevant leads with supporting data, and improve retention.
With lead enrichment, your sales team can correctly classify and route the leads to get the process started or begin the process of sales nurturing.
Lead enrichment helps your team improve their sales process by:

Lead nurturing is the process of establishing meaningful relationships with prospects throughout their journey via the sales funnel. By understanding the prospective lead better with lead enrichment tools, you can create highly personalised communication scripts to nurture leads directly by answering their questions, dissipating their doubts, and walking them through the benefits of your product.
A manual approach to leads is tedious and requires your sales reps to spend hours scouting on the internet for leads, verifying it, and killing precious time for prompt outreach. Automating lead enrichment is the smart thing to do.
Let’s learn the different ways of automating lead enrichment:
As your marketing and sales team works tirelessly to score potential leads, they will want to ensure that they meet certain criteria and are made visible to sales. To make this process quicker, integrate your CRM software such as HubSpot, Zoho, or Freshdesk with a sales automation tool such as Salesken and implement a data flow that syncs the data between the two seamlessly.
The accrued data can go well beyond contact information and include specific data to help your reps engage with leads effectively.
Fast-growing organisations worldwide are leaving behind hours of manual work for smart automation tools to get the struggle out of their way.
By switching to an automation tool, you can:
The most preferred method for direct follow-ups is email marketing for converting and nurturing leads.
Email marketing offers the highest return on investment for most businesses, especially small ones. It helps nurture prospects and active customers, build brand awareness, deliver personalised messages for specific user segments, run A/B tests for sales messages and share the company’s achievements and latest offerings.
However, email marketing is not always the easiest as people change jobs, roles, and email addresses go cold. By switching to tools like Salesken, you can nurture leads with smart email automation to automatically run these processes regularly. You can also connect your CRM software with Salesken to sync everything at all times!
According to research by McKinsey, organisations that have harnessed the power of AI in sales have seen massive benefits, including an increase in leads and appointments by over 50%, cost reductions by 40%, and call time reductions by 60%.
Here are some of the ways that AI enables leads for your team:
Overall, highly optimised sales processes backed by AI are already here. Lead enrichment, especially for B2B businesses is a boon for sales reps and managers on the whole. AI-enabled sales can improve productivity, decision making, and overall effectiveness to supercharge the customer experience.

To make this process quicker, integrate your CRM software such as HubSpot, Zoho, or Freshdesk with a sales automation tool such as Salesken and implement a data flow that syncs the data between the two seamlessly.
The accrued data can go well beyond contact information and include specific data to help your reps engage with leads effectively.
Fast-growing organisations worldwide are leaving behind hours of manual work for smart automation tools to get the struggle out of their way.
By switching to an automation tool, you can:
The most preferred method for direct follow-ups is email marketing for converting and nurturing leads.
Email marketing offers the highest return on investment for most businesses, especially small ones. It helps nurture prospects and active customers, build brand awareness, deliver personalised messages for specific user segments, run A/B tests for sales messages and share the company’s achievements and latest offerings.
However, email marketing is not always the easiest as people change jobs, roles, and email addresses go cold. By switching to tools like Salesken, you can nurture leads with smart email automation to automatically run these processes regularly. You can also connect your CRM software with Salesken to sync everything at all times!
According to research by McKinsey, organisations that have harnessed the power of AI in sales have seen massive benefits, including an increase in leads and appointments by over 50%, cost reductions by 40%, and call time reductions by 60%.
Here are some of the ways that AI enables leads for your team:
Overall, highly optimised sales processes backed by AI are already here. Lead enrichment, especially for B2B businesses is a boon for sales reps and managers on the whole. AI-enabled sales can improve productivity, decision making, and overall effectiveness to supercharge the customer experience.

Sales organizations are the heart of many businesses across the world. It is essential for such organizations to visualize their sales efforts. Without proper visibility into your sales activities, it is challenging for you to form your next sales strategies. This is exactly where the concept of “Sales Pipeline” comes into the picture.
An organization’s sales pipeline is nothing but the visual representation of each buyer’s journey. Through a sales pipeline, businesses get an idea of how close a prospect is to completing a purchase.
The process of sales pipeline analysis is about evaluating why a particular contact succeeds or fails in the last set of activities before closing a sales deal. To perform the pipeline analysis successfully, you’ll need to analyze the key metrics with an effective CRM tool.
This blog will discuss how you can analyze a sales pipeline and pinpoint the top five metrics to track for greater insight into your sales pipeline.
So, let’s get started.
Your sales pipeline represents every email, meeting, or call that may take place in a sales cycle. All these are tricks to close a sales deal. The purpose of sales pipeline analysis is to get insights into your pipeline and find out which prospects are ready to complete a purchase and which prospects need more persuasion.
In order to complete a sales pipeline analysis process efficiently and to gain a sales pipeline visualization, you need to track certain KPIs. In the next section of this article, we’ll explain these metrics in detail.
Are you wondering, how to evaluate the sales pipeline? Well, you need to understand the significance of each sales pipeline metric first. If you continue to track these metrics regularly, you’ll be able to generate an accurate sales pipeline report.
Below are the metrics to start with:
You should start your sales pipeline analysis by tracking this metric. It is impossible to close more sales deals if you don’t have qualified leads in your sales pipeline. By qualified leads, we mean the prospects who are ready to buy from you. These leads can help you achieve prompt conversion rates.
A robust sales pipeline is filled with new leads every week. By tracking this metric regularly, you can get visibility on the following aspects:
Another metric that determines the health of your sales pipeline is the conversion rate per stage. Since the sales cycle consists of many stages, it is important to identify the conversion rate in each stage. By tracking this metric regularly, you’ll get an idea of how well your sales pipeline is doing. In fact, this metric can also notify you of any upcoming potential shifts of customers in your current sales pipeline.
In most cases, your CRM software can calculate the conversion rate per stage. However, you should also keep a closer look at the historical datasets to compare your lead conversion rates over time. An in-depth CRM pipeline report can help you with these.
This metric shows the amount of money that’s passing through your sales pipeline every day. The value of sales pipeline velocity depends on how fast the leads are getting converted through your sales pipeline. This metric is a critical one to understand how healthy a sales pipeline is. Also, you can find those leads that are taking a long time to get converted.
Calculating sales pipeline velocity is pretty easy. You can use the following formula:
Let’s clear things out with an example. Suppose, you have 100 sales deals in your pipeline and the average size of the deals is = $2000. Say, your average sales cycle is 30 days long.
Then your sales pipeline velocity would be = [(100*2000)/30] = $6666.67
This means, every day, an amount worth $6666.67 passes through your sales pipeline. Note that the higher the value of this metric, the better.
Getting visibility over your overall sales pipeline value is important. This metric requires you to add up the total value of each deal in a particular stage. This overall value represents the total pipeline value of a sales pipeline.
Evidently, the higher the value of the overall sales pipeline, the better. Don’t forget to track this metric regularly since it offers major revenue generation opportunities. But, it is always better to maintain realistic expectations. All the sales deals won’t close on the same day.
That’s the very reason why you should calculate the value of this metric on a stage basis. You can break down your sales cycle into three stages, namely leads, opportunities, and the number of meetings booked.
As you move ahead in your sales pipeline, you’ll see that overall sales pipeline value is declining. But that’s normal. This also indicates that your prospects are getting closer to signing a business deal.
It is also very important to track how each sales rep is performing and what their individual contributions are towards your overall sales pipeline. This metric tells you exactly that. Additionally, this metric also helps you identify if your sales reps require any individual assistance or motivation.
For example, suppose one of your sales reps is doing pretty well in terms of prospecting. This individual is bringing in new leads every day. However, a very lower percentage of these leads are getting converted. This clearly means that this particular rep requires training to improve their lead conversion skills.
The formula to estimate your sales rep pipeline performance is the same as the conversion rate per stage metric. Only here, you need to estimate for the sales reps, individually. This metric is essential to understand how well the reps perform individually and what support they require.
Are you looking to gain real-time visibility into your sales pipeline? Your search should end with Salesken. We’ll help you to develop detailed insights over your sales pipeline throughout. Here’s how we can help you to:

Sales Insight
Green Leaf is an ed-tech company, specially designed for children aged between 6-18 years.
The ed-tech company kicked off its business by providing coding classes for children via one-to-one live classes by the top 1% of selected teachers and subject matter exports.
Green Leaf helps children fascinated with technology by teaching them the fundamentals of coding, sequence, logic, and algorithm.
Post the acquisition by a larger Ed tech organization, the company has launched programs in English, Portuguese, and Spanish for students in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil.
With its recent acquisition, Green Leaf has expanded into other facets of overall early education, including music, fine art, and language classes.
The company has over 9,500 teachers and 100,000 subscribed students as of today working with a mission to empower a whole generation to become creators as opposed to mere consumers of technology.
Despite the relatively new launch of the company, Green Leaf’s set of challenges arrived with the onset of COVID-19 in 2020.
Onboarding and training of new academic advisors were a fundamental issue with the entire workforce around the globe working remotely.
Most organizations across the world had to make sweeping changes to address their most pressing needs. With unprecedented levels of disruption in everyone’s homes, communities, and even jobs, adjusting to the new normal was quite a bumpy road for everyone.
Green Leaf was no different.
New team members did not have access to high-end office accessories and with the sudden shift in the working environment, Green Leaf was actively looking out for a solution to integrate their existing technology stack.
This essentially means that Green Leaf had to onboard new teams online, and provide them with all the necessary tools to succeed as new team members.
And this challenge also raised the problem of defining and creating new metrics to assess and improve their sales team’s performance.
With Salesken’s easy one-click integration, Green Leaf not only was able to successfully onboard new hires but could also seamlessly integrate their current technology stack.
While most businesses fear short-term uncertainty and are most definitely unnerving, many pioneers such as Green Leaf viewed it as a litmus test to analyze their remote workforce productivity and its effectiveness.
Salesken’s easy accessibility with corresponding technology available both on desktop and mobile, enabled academic advisors the flexibility to engage with parents at their convenience.
Green Leaf leveraged Salesken’s Conversation Intelligence capabilities to gain complete visibility into every customer interaction and assist the advisors to convey Green Leaf’s unique value proposition.
Green Leaf’s initial fear about making their onboarding process for new hires was tackled with extreme ease.
Salesken’s endless features and seamless integrations helped Green Leaf drastically improve their team members’ productivity. As a result, this helped them increase their number of users by 15x!
In addition, Salesken’s Conversation Intelligence assisted sales managers and team members to leverage in-built features such as real-time calling, call summaries, insights, and more to boost their calls to more than 90K every day.
With an increase in workforce and hassle-free sales processes, Green Leaf’s team members could lower their CAC by 10% within just 60 days of using Salesken.

Historically, sales success has relied on intuition and subjectivity. Sales reps conduct in-depth research on prospects and then chase the most suitable fits. This process relies on trial and error to figure out prospects’ expectations and apply the rep’s intuitions to understand prospects’ pain points.
However, things are changing nowadays. Reps use sales data analysis to make critical decisions. Adopting a data-driven sales approach takes subjectivity out of the equation and makes the whole process of selling more predictable and efficient.
This article will discuss sales data analysis and how B2B organizations can leverage it for better decision-making. So, let’s begin.
Sales data is any information that your sales team can utilize to improve their decision-making. Sales data can provide actionable insights into a sales team’s performance, help them build better strategies, and improve organizational decision-making.
If you can generate sufficient sales data from various sources and your sales team knows how to interpret these datasets, you’re all set. Advanced software and cloud CRM solutions can help you generate a large volume of sales data. But collecting sales data is not always enough. You have to figure out how to use these datasets, identify improvement areas and plan how your decisions will change by using these datasets.
The most important question here may be which sales data analysis tool you should use to make the most of the sales data? If you’re seeking an answer to all these questions, don’t worry. We have it all covered.
B2B organizations should be highly involved in their sales decision-making process. And to do that, they must learn how to leverage sales data properly. But, why do sales data even matter?
Let us help you out here:
Your ideal customer is any individual who intends to buy your products and services. But the question is how do you discover the individuals who have sufficient purchase intent and are willing to purchase from you? That’s where the concept of sales data comes into the picture.
With essential sales datasets like the individual’s name, job title, company details, and email address, it becomes easier to find out whether or not a prospect will be interested in purchasing from you. If you can develop a basic idea of the prospect’s buying intent, it becomes simpler for you to figure out whether or not the prospect will be a good fit for further interaction.
One of the major activities of any sales rep is reaching out to more prospects through cold calls, social selling, and emails. But it will be a complete waste of time for them if they don’t have proper sales data.
Your reps can’t reach out to just anyone and everyone. For a data-driven B2B lead generation, appropriate sales information is a must.
Sales managers are always seeking new ways to improve their sales team’s performance. But how are they supposed to do that if they don’t have actionable insights?
A sales database helps the sales managers to identify and track relevant sales data. Therefore it becomes easier to figure out where the backlogs are and how they can streamline the sales process.
A data-driven sales approach can win you more customers and build long-term relationships. Here are the six major ways to use sales data for fast growth and transformation:
High-quality sales data can be a major source of new lead generation for your sales team. Once you have successfully collected the sales data from authentic sources, you can use a sales analytics tool like Salesken to discover the purchase intent of the prospects. Such a tool can help you with lead scoring. That way, reps will understand which prospect is most likely to convert into customers and can direct their efforts accordingly.
Some popular sources of high-quality sales data are as follows:
Not all customers will fit the criteria of your buyer persona. In B2B selling, reps should always focus on converting leads who are a good fit. B2B lead generation process involves high costs, energy, and a lot of valuable time. You can’t risk your conversion process by targeting bad-fit prospects as it will delay your whole lead generation process.
With quality sales data and a proper sales data analysis process, you can answer the following questions:
Once you answer these questions, you can easily position a prospect based on your target buyer persona and keep going from there.
High-quality sales data not only help you identify the proper leads but also helps you nurture them with suitable strategies and approaches.
Here are the best ways to leverage sales data for better relationship building:
Trial and error is the secret to a successful sales or marketing campaign, so what’s better than a regular trial and error process? A data-driven one. So, use the collected sales data to experiment and apply the results to modify your marketing strategy.
Try different ways of communication with your prospects. From email outreach to social media outreach, try it all. Also, don’t stop at the experiments. Analyze the results and build your sales strategy accordingly.
Use a sales enablement tool like Salesken to track your sales team’s performance regularly. Here’s how it can help:
Use consistent sales data to support your sales decision-making process. Updated sales datasets can predict future sales patterns for your team and drive more lead generation opportunities.
Quality sales data empowers the decision-making process and generates new opportunities for your team. It is the first step towards developing a data-driven sales team.
Sales data analysis is a major driving factor behind the significant sales of your organization. Here’s how you can improve data analysis in sales:
When you’re analyzing sales data, you have to focus on multiple data sources at the same time. Plus, each of these sources can generate a large volume of data. So, there’s no way to do this manually. Manual analysis of sales data can take you months if not years. So, the best way to deal with this is through automation. Use end-to-end automation to collect, store and analyze the sales datasets. That way, you can spend more meaningful time analyzing these datasets.
While decision-making, make sure to focus on data visualization. Use a consolidated dashboard where you can witness dynamic visualization with graphs, charts (bar charts, line charts, comparison charts, slope charts), and other actionable insights. That way you can develop actionable insights and build apt strategies for your sales team’s future convenience.
Sales data can be tough to manage, but we have solutions for it; however, big data is extremely different since it contains a large amount of data that can be challenging for any organization. So, if you have huge data that you want to utilize, you might think about contacting some of the popular big data companies.
Some of the major sales data sources to track regularly are:
Remember that sales data and proper sales data analysis tools can speed up your growth rapidly. Make sure that you invest in a sales data analysis tool at the earliest. It will open new doors of opportunities for your sales team and ensure higher conversion. Make the most of your sales data and build a data-driven sales team with Salesken.

Sales performance management (SPM) is a data-driven approach to track an organisation’s sales performance. With sales performance management software, you can plan, analyse, and manage your organisation's sales performance and improve decision making.
However, before you get SPM software, you must understand what it is, how it works, and how it can help you scale up. That’s what we’ll be covering in this blog.
So, without further ado, let’s get started!
A sales performance management software helps the sales managers to streamline various activities associated with the sales team. These can include:
It is like a sales monitoring system that tracks all the above functions to maintain the sales team's overall performance. SPM software includes different tools like Business Intelligence, advanced dashboards, etc., to visualize the sales teams’ actions. Some sales performance management software also includes various gamification functions, contests, quizzes, etc., to motivate the reps.
If you’re planning for a business expansion, getting SPM software should be on your agenda. Here’s why:
SPM software helps sales teams with better sales pipeline management. The concept of a sales pipeline is very common for each organisation. It is an organized way of tracking the prospects of an organisation through various stages. The presence of SPM software helps sales teams to get clear visibility into their sales pipelines.
That way, they can identify which prospect is in which stage and how close are the reps in closing a sales deal. At an enterprise level, it helps you predict the sales trends of your company. Hence, sales managers can create a sales team scorecard and plan the incentives accordingly.
An organisation generates a variety of sales data from different channels and tools. However, they often fail to aggregate these datasets to gain data-driven insights. That’s exactly where SPM software like SalesKen comes into the picture.
These sales performance management software types come with advanced features like customer intent scoring, real-time sales assistance, targeted sales training, and clear visibility into your sales activities. With intent scoring, you can identify a prospect’s intent to make a purchase, and accordingly, you can chase them.
The real-time sales assistance feature comes with an AI assistant who would customise your sales pitches so that you can track the top reps evidently. Also, with real-time sales coaching, the prospects can get instant feedback and align their sales approaches in the right direction.
With all these features and functions, organisations can easily develop a data-driven approach and plan their sales strategy effectively. SPM tool is highly useful for sales team performance monitoring and decision making.
Maintaining a productive sales workforce is essential for every organisation. However, the challenge lies in keeping the employees productive. Largely because sales reps have to handle many objections and rejections in their day-to-day lives. All these can leave them demotivated and therefore less productive. However, with sales performance management software by your side, you can easily uplift the productivity level of your sales team.
SPM software comes with built-in sales productivity tools like training resources, courses, real-time coaching, etc. All these help the reps to evaluate their sales pitches and rethink their approaches while prospecting. Rather than focusing on best practices, SPM software helps the reps to find out their individual strengths and weaknesses. Hence, you can execute a targeted training where you work on the strengths and weaknesses of each sales rep.
Hence, these productivity initiatives can easily keep your reps well-trained and help them win more deals.
Sales territory management is a crucial part of sales performance management, more so because it is directly linked to the incentive management part. It is highly essential that you define the sales territories properly so that each sales rep has an individual territory of their own.
But is that it? Not really!
While assigning a territory to a rep, you need to ensure that the rep’s skills and expertise match the local factors of the territory. That means the rep should be able to interact with the target prospects of that territory. Hence, taking a generic approach will not help the territory management part.
To ensure that the right reps are allocated for the right territories, you need to focus on a data-driven approach. That’s why using SPM software is mandatory. With in-depth sales intelligence, such software can help you match the individual rep’s capacity with their target territories. As a result, it becomes easier for sales managers to decide which territory will be apt for which sales rep.
Therefore, you can manage the sales team scorecard and plan accurate performance-based incentives for the reps. Hence, there will be no under-payment or over-payment. Sales reps will also stay motivated as there will be zero biasedness.
Sales teams need to engage in development activities frequently. That way, they can stay up to date with the latest industry trends and apply these trends in their sales pitches. So, if you’re focused on continuous skill-building, you should think seriously about getting SPM software.
Each SPM software has rich features like regular training, motivational tools, sales efficiency manager, sales productivity tools, etc. All these are effective in keeping the employees on track and helping them to stay motivated throughout their sales journeys.
Are you looking for SPM software for your business? Make sure that you look for the following features:
SPM software goes beyond regular CRM reports and generates in-depth sales visibility. It can capture sales data from multiple sources like sales pipeline, social media channels, CRM tools and consolidate it all to create in-depth insights.
Hence, sales teams can develop clear perspectives on which prospects are worth chasing, the lead conversion or non-conversion insights and so on. Therefore, leaders can take actionable steps based on this information.
An ideal SPM software includes different types of advanced sales tools on a single dashboard. The purpose is to measure an organisation’s sales performance and keep track of all the latest sales trends on a single dashboard. SPM software pulls relevant sales data from different sources and assembles it all to help in informed decision-making. Most sales performance management software offers different types of dashboard templates that are customisable for an organisation’s requirements.
In most cases, SPM software also includes gamification tools like quizzes, badges, contests, etc. The purpose is to use these tools to motivate the reps and increase their productivity through various fun activities. These tools can create a competitive environment and encourage the reps to achieve their targets. Customised gamification tools come with various reward and recognition opportunities. That way, you can appreciate the reps for their hard work and offer them befitting rewards.
SPM software should offer 360-degree visibility into your user base. It should entail all details about your customers and their contacts within a single database. Make sure that your sales performance management software records customers’ contact details in one place so that you can use and track this information whenever needed.
This will help you get a hold of all activities you’re involved in and how you can use these datasets to strengthen your sales strategy. Furthermore, you can use this data to predict customers’ purchase decisions and modify your sales pitch accordingly. This can be a smart way to win customers’ trust.
A sales performance management software also lets you manage all opportunities and leads in a single place. You can track your competitors, interact with the decision-makers, create sales pitches, and design your sales strategy accordingly. Adding leads from different sources to your dashboard also becomes seamless with SPM software.
Are you planning to revamp your sales strategy and process with SPM software? Your search should end with SalesKen.

Sales performance management (SPM) is a data-driven approach to track an organisation’s sales performance. With sales performance management software, you can plan, analyse, and manage your organisation's sales performance and improve decision making.
However, before you get SPM software, you must understand what it is, how it works, and how it can help you scale up. That’s what we’ll be covering in this blog.
So, without further ado, let’s get started!
A sales performance management software helps the sales managers to streamline various activities associated with the sales team. These can include:
It is like a sales monitoring system that tracks all the above functions to maintain the sales team's overall performance. SPM software includes different tools like Business Intelligence, advanced dashboards, etc., to visualize the sales teams’ actions. Some sales performance management software also includes various gamification functions, contests, quizzes, etc., to motivate the reps.
If you’re planning for a business expansion, getting SPM software should be on your agenda. Here’s why:
SPM software helps sales teams with better sales pipeline management. The concept of a sales pipeline is very common for each organisation. It is an organized way of tracking the prospects of an organisation through various stages. The presence of SPM software helps sales teams to get clear visibility into their sales pipelines.
That way, they can identify which prospect is in which stage and how close are the reps in closing a sales deal. At an enterprise level, it helps you predict the sales trends of your company. Hence, sales managers can create a sales team scorecard and plan the incentives accordingly.
An organisation generates a variety of sales data from different channels and tools. However, they often fail to aggregate these datasets to gain data-driven insights. That’s exactly where SPM software like SalesKen comes into the picture.
These sales performance management software types come with advanced features like customer intent scoring, real-time sales assistance, targeted sales training, and clear visibility into your sales activities. With intent scoring, you can identify a prospect’s intent to make a purchase, and accordingly, you can chase them.
The real-time sales assistance feature comes with an AI assistant who would customise your sales pitches so that you can track the top reps evidently. Also, with real-time sales coaching, the prospects can get instant feedback and align their sales approaches in the right direction.
With all these features and functions, organisations can easily develop a data-driven approach and plan their sales strategy effectively. SPM tool is highly useful for sales team performance monitoring and decision making.
Maintaining a productive sales workforce is essential for every organisation. However, the challenge lies in keeping the employees productive. Largely because sales reps have to handle many objections and rejections in their day-to-day lives. All these can leave them demotivated and therefore less productive. However, with sales performance management software by your side, you can easily uplift the productivity level of your sales team.
SPM software comes with built-in sales productivity tools like training resources, courses, real-time coaching, etc. All these help the reps to evaluate their sales pitches and rethink their approaches while prospecting. Rather than focusing on best practices, SPM software helps the reps to find out their individual strengths and weaknesses. Hence, you can execute a targeted training where you work on the strengths and weaknesses of each sales rep.
Hence, these productivity initiatives can easily keep your reps well-trained and help them win more deals.
Sales territory management is a crucial part of sales performance management, more so because it is directly linked to the incentive management part. It is highly essential that you define the sales territories properly so that each sales rep has an individual territory of their own.
But is that it? Not really!
While assigning a territory to a rep, you need to ensure that the rep’s skills and expertise match the local factors of the territory. That means the rep should be able to interact with the target prospects of that territory. Hence, taking a generic approach will not help the territory management part.
To ensure that the right reps are allocated for the right territories, you need to focus on a data-driven approach. That’s why using SPM software is mandatory. With in-depth sales intelligence, such software can help you match the individual rep’s capacity with their target territories. As a result, it becomes easier for sales managers to decide which territory will be apt for which sales rep.
Therefore, you can manage the sales team scorecard and plan accurate performance-based incentives for the reps. Hence, there will be no under-payment or over-payment. Sales reps will also stay motivated as there will be zero biasedness.
Sales teams need to engage in development activities frequently. That way, they can stay up to date with the latest industry trends and apply these trends in their sales pitches. So, if you’re focused on continuous skill-building, you should think seriously about getting SPM software.
Each SPM software has rich features like regular training, motivational tools, sales efficiency manager, sales productivity tools, etc. All these are effective in keeping the employees on track and helping them to stay motivated throughout their sales journeys.
Are you looking for SPM software for your business? Make sure that you look for the following features:
SPM software goes beyond regular CRM reports and generates in-depth sales visibility. It can capture sales data from multiple sources like sales pipeline, social media channels, CRM tools and consolidate it all to create in-depth insights.
Hence, sales teams can develop clear perspectives on which prospects are worth chasing, the lead conversion or non-conversion insights and so on. Therefore, leaders can take actionable steps based on this information.
An ideal SPM software includes different types of advanced sales tools on a single dashboard. The purpose is to measure an organisation’s sales performance and keep track of all the latest sales trends on a single dashboard. SPM software pulls relevant sales data from different sources and assembles it all to help in informed decision-making. Most sales performance management software offers different types of dashboard templates that are customisable for an organisation’s requirements.
In most cases, SPM software also includes gamification tools like quizzes, badges, contests, etc. The purpose is to use these tools to motivate the reps and increase their productivity through various fun activities. These tools can create a competitive environment and encourage the reps to achieve their targets. Customised gamification tools come with various reward and recognition opportunities. That way, you can appreciate the reps for their hard work and offer them befitting rewards.
SPM software should offer 360-degree visibility into your user base. It should entail all details about your customers and their contacts within a single database. Make sure that your sales performance management software records customers’ contact details in one place so that you can use and track this information whenever needed.
This will help you get a hold of all activities you’re involved in and how you can use these datasets to strengthen your sales strategy. Furthermore, you can use this data to predict customers’ purchase decisions and modify your sales pitch accordingly. This can be a smart way to win customers’ trust.
A sales performance management software also lets you manage all opportunities and leads in a single place. You can track your competitors, interact with the decision-makers, create sales pitches, and design your sales strategy accordingly. Adding leads from different sources to your dashboard also becomes seamless with SPM software.
Are you planning to revamp your sales strategy and process with SPM software? Your search should end with SalesKen.

Have you ever invested hours trying to convince a lead only to learn they don’t even have a requirement? It’s every salesperson’s biggest nightmare and a complete waste of your time, energy, and cost. Sales prospecting is all about ensuring that the lead requires your product to begin with and is a good fit for you to move ahead.
Instead of targeting random leads, if you can spend some time on researching and using the right tools to identify a lead’s purchase intent, it becomes more straightforward for you to drive more sales. Every sales team’s goal should be to adopt a data-centric approach that helps them land on those leads with the maximum purchase intent.
In this sales prospecting guide, you’ll find some unconventional tips and prospecting strategies to get started.
Prospecting is the very first phase of a sales process. Sales prospecting doesn’t focus on converting a lead into a paying customer. Instead, it tries to convert a prospect into a potential customer by analysing their purchase intent. Sales teams use prospecting data to fulfil the following objectives:
Business prospecting helps you identify customers who are the right fit for your organisation.
That means even prospects seek to connect with reps who understand their pain points and offer suitable solutions.
The lead prospecting practice is highly significant. Here’s why it matters:
A sales pipeline should be filled with potential leads that are most likely to convert. Businesses should have an active strategy to fill their sales pipeline. Else, the sales team will struggle. With sales prospecting, you can fill your sales pipeline with valuable leads with high-purchase intent. That way, your prospects can only invest their efforts on leads that will convert soon.
Want to expedite your sales process? Build strategies that can help you stay ahead of your competitors. Sales prospecting can help you discover the lead conversion strategies your competitors are using to grow sales.
Sales prospecting is all about going in-depth to understand your prospects’ needs and offering them relevant solutions. When your prospects are involved in core prospect research, they can easily gain useful competitive insights to leverage later in the sales cycle.
Leads and prospects are different from each other. A lead is someone who has expressed some interest in your products and services by visiting your website, subscribing to your newsletters, or signing up for your free demo. However, can a lead be your target customer? Not always. A prospect, on the other hand, is a qualified lead and a perfect fit with your buyer persona.
An active sales prospecting process can help your reps differentiate the leads from the prospects. Hence, it becomes easier for them to figure out whom to nurture with the hope to convert into a paid customer.
Here are some of the top lead prospecting strategies that can help you build a more efficient sales process:
Sales prospecting requires consistency. You can’t master it or complete it in one day. So, the best way is to dedicate some time to sales prospecting every day. Sales reps already have too much on their plate. If they don’t block some time specifically for client prospecting every day, they may very well miss out on this practice.
The prospecting time you set should be aligned with your target customers’ availability. You can’t reach out to them at an odd time when they’re not ready to connect with reps. To maximise the chances of getting a response, set a time that suits both you and your prospects.
When it comes to B2B sales, event marketing is still a thing.
The biggest reason behind leveraging event marketing is that you can reach out to like-minded people who are genuinely interested in your offerings.
Suppose you’re hosting a webinar and you promote it on social media. Who do you think will sign-up for this event? Definitely, people who are interested in the topic you’re covering. So, even if you have a fewer number of attendees, the majority of them are your prospects. That definitely makes sales prospecting easier.
But then again, the events you’re planning should be impactful. That’s the only way to make your sales prospecting process count. So, find the answers to these questions first:
The secret to efficient sales prospecting is in-depth research. The more you research, the better you know your prospects, their pain points, and requirements. This will help you ace the very first cold call. Cold calls don’t always have to be odd and full of rejections. In fact, with proper research, you’ll approach leads who’re interested in your products, which means higher chances of conversion.
Are you exhausted with all the research? Well, you can use a speech analytics tool like SalesKen instead. SalesKen helps you with actionable lead scoring insights for sales and marketing. That means you can analyse a rep’s conversation with a prospect through this tool to find out a prospect’s purchase intent. Hence, you can connect with those prospects who are the most interested in your products. That means optimum utilisation of your time and effort.
Sales prospecting is not at all about selling. It may sound ironic but you don’t ask a prospect to buy from at the very first interaction. Instead, try to build relationships with them and slowly nurture them. If this goes well, the prospect will convert on their own. Hard-selling may have been a conventional sales tactic, but it doesn’t work with today’s prospects. They want to know more about a product before they can actually invest in it.
A study by HubSpot shows that 61% of buyers don’t want the reps to be assertive.
Instead, they expect relevant information from the reps to place a product with respect to their needs. So, build relationships, and you’ll see an immediate boost in your sales prospecting process.
Want to follow a quick sales prospecting process? Break down your prospects into different segments. Here’s how:
Prospect score: High
Prospect score: Medium
Prospect score: Low
Now that you can differentiate your prospects, doesn’t it simplify the sales prospecting process? It easily tells you which prospects are most likely to purchase from you and those who are not. So, you can plan your efforts strategically.
Today, social media research can be a major part of your sales prospecting process. You can track your prospects on all social platforms as most profiles are public. But we recommend prioritising Twitter and Linkedin. Twitter works on trigger-based marketing, making it easy to discover needs and intent, so you can leverage this information to nurture the prospects. For B2B sales prospecting, LinkedIn can also be a huge source of opportunity. You can adjust your sales strategy accordingly.
Leverage a healthy mix of email and phone communication to avail the following benefits of both modes:
Email Marketing
Phone communication
Just a little bit of mix and match between these two communication modes can help you enjoy the best of both worlds.
Your target buyers are the busy decision-makers of large companies. The same old tricks may not always work for them. So, try to find new ways and strategies to educate your prospects. A cool way to approach this is through various Q&A platforms. You can use Quora, Reddit, Moz Community and other forums to find out what the buyers are discussing or what they’re looking for in a solution. This information can simplify the positioning for you.
Want to keep a close eye on your prospects? Subscribe to their blogs and newsletters. Here’s how it can go:
This will help you fine-tune your value proposition and ensure that you’re only using relevant information in your emails.
So, what are you waiting for? Get started with the sales prospecting process and use these strategies. Reps should remember that sales prospecting is a consistent process. Also, you can’t perfect it overnight. So, be patient and keep it going. You’ll observe the results pretty soon.
As mentioned, SalesKen can help you identify purchase intent and score your leads by evaluating conversations with customers. To learn more, book a demo now.

The B2B industry is massive. It is currently in the growth phase. By 2023, The US B2B eCommerce industry alone will reach $1.8 trillion. But does that mean the B2B businesses have figured it all out?
Well, not exactly.
Creating a seamless B2B customer journey becomes challenging sometimes. One of the biggest issues B2B companies are facing in recent times is making their customer journey as smooth as that of B2C.
The key to creating a successful B2B customer journey includes dedicated team efforts, top-notch customer support, and above all, a strategic plan in place. But, of course, easier said than done. In reality, marketers need to go several extra miles to ensure the convenience of the B2B customer journey.
This article will cover some of the major tactics to improve the B2B customer journey. So, let’s begin!
A customer journey map/customer journey outlines the stages that a customer passes through while building a relationship with your brand. A comprehensive customer journey map is essential since it covers different stages of a customer’s journey starting from lead acquisition, conversion, purchase, upsell, referrals, and so on.
In a typical B2B SaaS customer journey, you’ll find the following stages:
A customer journey map breaks down all these stages into several customer journey sub-stages to provide detailed insights on a customers’ mindset, the loopholes, and the improvement areas for a better B2B customer journey. Hence, B2B brands should make it a point to create a powerful B2B customer journey map.
Now that you understand the concept of a customer journey map and know its effectiveness, it’s time that you start with your own B2B digital customer journey map. Here’re a few tips to start with:
So, start with these tricks and create your very first customer journey map.
Are you looking for ways to improve your B2B SaaS customer journey? It’s time that you start following these tips that worked wonders for us in customer journey management:
Personalization is the key to standing out in an overly competitive B2B industry. This is true for your sales team too. A single sales strategy can hardly work for all your B2B customers. In fact, it can affect your B2B customer journey on various levels. Hence, organizations should focus on training their sales reps so that they know about their target customers and their expectations and match these with your brand’s offerings to boost conversion. Reps should also get the chance to evaluate their interactions with customers in order to find out the improvement areas.
A great way to personalize sales activities is through sales enablement software. SalesKen’s sales enablement software can help you analyze your sales reps’ conversations with customers to find the gaps and build strategies for improvement. A sales enablement software can guide your reps during the lead nurturing process and help them close more deals confidently. It can build a data-driven sales approach and work as a confidence booster for your sales team.
Every B2B brands create content. However, they often make the mistake of not adding sufficient value for their target audience. To improve the journey of your B2B customers, you should add as much value through your content as possible. That’s the key to making a mark and outperforming your competitors. Remember that your prospects are always looking for a service that provides maximum return on their investment. So, content that’s not value-driven can hardly achieve desired results.
Switching to an omnichannel strategy will help you acquire more leads through your sales funnel. An omnichannel strategy is the best way to convert larger numbers of browsers into customers. So, if you’re still following a single-channel strategy, you’re missing out on a lot of opportunities. Also, make sure that all of the business channels are interconnected.
For example, you may reach out to a client through email, but don’t forget to add your social profiles in your email signature so that the same customer can reach you through a social channel if they prefer. An omnichannel strategy can be costly, especially for startups. However, the results of executing a successful omnichannel strategy can be exemplary.
Never stop experimenting with your marketing tactics. Most B2B companies stop exploring new tactics as soon as they find one strategy that works. However, in marketing, the one-size-fits-it-all approach doesn’t really work. You have to keep experimenting with the latest marketing trends to see how you can transform the B2B customer journey. For years, B2C organizations have been changing their marketing approach to achieve customer satisfaction. It’s high time that B2B brands also adopt this perspective to develop pro marketing plans.
Finally, make sure that you’re focusing largely on retaining the existing customers. Concentrating on new customer acquisition doesn’t mean neglecting the existing ones. A great way to improve retention and enhance the B2B customer journey is through interaction. Ask customers what they feel and how you can improve their experiences. You can arrange surveys, polls, 1:1 sessions to find out customers’ demands and adjust your strategies accordingly.
Suppose you have developed a B2B customer journey map for your business. But what next? You need to know how you can utilize it to improve your B2B customer journey. Here are some ways to harness the findings of your B2B customer journey map in favor of your business:
A customer journey map guides you through your sales funnel and shows you the points where leads drop off. This is a great way to find out the gaps and change them into converting hooks. Suppose your customer journey map shows that majorities of the leads drop off from your Blogs/Resource page. This would simply mean that your blogs do not represent your brand’s messaging properly or fail to educate the prospects. Hence, the finding from the B2B digital customer journey map will focus on improving your blog section and writing more relevant content.
Once you figure out the gaps from the customer journey map, you should scrutinize each of these drop points properly. For example, if the Blog page is a major dropping point for your website, you need to go on to check each blog. Or say, most of the prospects are dropping off from your sales funnel after receiving your emails. That would mean evaluating each email that is going out to examine what’s lacking in them and how one can make them more personalized.
A customer journey map shows you all the customer touchpoints to get an idea of the big picture. Marketers should make an individual evaluation of each of these touchpoints to identify more personalization opportunities. For example, let’s assume that you’re targeting both B2B and B2C users. Evidently, the requirements of both these groups are completely different. The B2C users can demand low prices, whereas B2B users will expect more features and scaling options. A customer journey map helps you differentiate between the expectations of these two groups of customers. Hence, you can make the changes based on the demands of the respective users.

It's 2023, and it's a digital-first world. Today's children learn to code before they learn cursive. To add to this, we've come across a myriad of ed-tech companies that indeed, make this dream come true.
We call this expertise digital skills but, for today's children, it's simply skills needed to be learned.
But what exactly are digital skills? And why do sales teams need it to succeed in their career?
To add to this, it's not just today's kids that are obsessed with technical knowledge.
For several sales professionals and sales managers, digital technologies aid them with a new channel to connect with and influence prospective customers, thus moving them from leads to customers.
In the modern age, speed is everything. This change is happening in response to the buying process that has evolved drastically; buyers have already changed their habits. As sales professionals, you need to catch up and be equipped with the right digital skills to build a lasting relationship with your customers and be ahead of the curve.
But, with the right training and guidance, sales teams, irrespective of their age, can acquire the key digital skills they need to become successful salespeople in 2023.
We have handpicked some essential skills that will help all the sales reps stay ahead in this digital world.
Sales is a highly competitive industry.
To thrive as a successful salesperson in this age, keeping up ahead of the market trends, new technologies, and relevant factors is what distinguishes between an average sales rep to a highly successful one.
Salespeople must know the art of researching online, and finding relevant information from online sources. Information about competitors can be found from review aggregators like G2, TrustRadius and other sources, and networking can help the reps understand their target customers and their industries better.
Possessing the knowledge to find the data online accurately, you can create ads and nurture your ideal customers with the right messaging and information,
This data can further be utilized to pinpoint personalized sales strategies that can help nurture and engage them in the sales cycle.
Digital literacy encompasses the digital sales skills needed to work, learn, and navigate day-to-day life in our sales world.
This means having the ability to use devices, software, apps, and more with confidence to communicate and collaborate better via digital mediums, handling data in a safe and appropriate way, and keeping abreast of new technologies.
With several social platforms out there in the market, it's absolutely vital to know which medium works the best for you with the audience you want to target and learn how to get your audience to notice you.
It is important to understand that there is no point in spending time curating catchy, and beautiful images on Instagram and Pinterest, when the audience you want to target are active on LinkedIn.
With a seemingly infinite number of social platforms out there, knowing which one to use for maximum success can be tricky.
Conduct appropriate market research and know every major platform to start posting regularly with relevant advertisements, promoting webinars and podcasts, and even maintaining an active profile will go a long way.
One of the most important sales skills to learn in this modern-day sales world is to analyze online customer behavior and data.
This sales skill can pose a distinct advantage as it endows them with the ability to be proactive and take a consumer-centric approach to sell their product or service with ease.
Possessing analytical knowledge can help you to unravel and evaluate your customers' habits, willingness to purchase your product or service, opportunities to push a sale, and more.
As a result, sales professionals will definitely be far more successful at meeting their sales goals and quotas regularly than alienating their customers.
Agility is quite the buzzword in today's digital age of selling.
However, agility is crucial in an ever-evolving digital sales environment. New developments in technology often turn today's sales environment quite obsolete. An agile sales rep will dive into new learning programs, get to know them inside out, and implement them to ensure success.
Additionally, agility allows sales reps to look at alternate solutions when the chosen strategy doesn't seem to be working.
Being agile and thinking on one's toes always allows sales teams to come up with various other plans that will clinch the sale.
Although curating and sharing content is essential, creating highly relevant content is vital.
This is a clear indication of the importance of creating unique, but highly relevant content that will capture the interest of prospective customers.
For instance, by publishing a fresh blog on LinkedIn or your company's blog, a salesperson's ability to showcase the depth of their knowledge and share key insights will build authority and engage prospects on a personal level is a fast-track route to bringing in more sales.
Time management is one of the important sales skills that every sales rep should possess.
Considering the number of sales activities they need to tick off every day, including interacting with multiple potential customers and clients, responding to emails, demonstrating the sales pitch, and more, making wise use of their time can improve things - both cost and productivity-wise.
Leveraging an automation software such as a CRM can greatly benefit your sales reps to handle their tasks more effectively and also, meet their goals effectively.
Although problem-solving entails soft sales skills, learning how to solve issues in the digital world, virtually, is an important skill.
Social sellers that provide profound, targeted insights and practical solutions to an issue will create a positive attitude and brand image online, thus, helping you to turn prospects into fully paid customers.
Tools such as Buzz Sumo, Feedly, and Social Mention enable sales reps to keep track of their prospects' movements on the internet with relevant keywords. Sales reps can also track conversations happening around your product or service, industry, and competitors.
Regular monitoring will help to identify pain points, issues, and recommendations that allow you to respond with valuable insights that lead to positive solutions.
Sales professionals that place themselves in their customer's shoes to ask the right questions and understand them deeply to analyze their pain points, expectations, and needs will win your trust and respect.
After all, loyal buyers could be valuable up to ten times more than new ones.
Listening skills are essential for salespeople, no doubt about it.
Conversations with prospects and current customers can be seamless when sales reps make conscious efforts to actually listen and absorb the information given to them.
Communication skills are fundamental in building trust and creating a positive rapport with customers. It's essential that salespeople are confident and knowledgeable when approaching and advising customers, but the value of truly listening can easily be overlooked.
The best way to ensure total coherence is to ask questions to understand their relevant pain points and summarize what you have been told.
A significant part of active listening is to treat others with compassion and respect you'd like to receive during a conversation, so they feel their requirements are well understood to meet mutual expectations.
In this day and age where social media and having an online presence is vital, creating a personal brand is vital to long-term career growth.
Branding is the only benefit that your competitors can never replace. Branding is your personality. It's true to itself and no one else can replace it. Copied, yes, but never replaced.
When managed correctly, branding is enough for your customers to keep coming back and make repeated purchases. Effective branding makes you more visible, memorable, and easily identifiable.
It attracts attention and accelerates the revenue engine.
Leverage sales technology that helps you stay on top of everyone's minds with impeccable branding and design, your own true unique value.
To continue the conversation and help your prospects and customers to trickle down further in the sales funnel, engagement is a key pillar to leverage to your existing tech stack.
This includes tools and technologies that drive proactive conversations such as social selling, social public speaking, and one-to-one engagement such as email, phone calls, and in-person and virtual meetings.
Having a myriad of engagement options readily available to your sales teams allows them to move forward from channel to channel to connect and interact better with sales prospects.
Regardless of the size of your company, having a vision and strategy is a must for all businesses.
Vision and strategy, when decided correctly, allow businesses to predict, work through, and meet their goals with less complexity, as opposed to businesses that have zero to no vision.
Vision is the most difficult pillar to establish since everyone in the company, right from the top to the bottom, must believe in it.
Digital sales transformation will fail indefinitely unless this foundation is established for everyone to prioritize. A non-existent digital strategy affects more than just the IT department.
It impacts everyone across the board and departments, and because the organization must continuously grow and evolve, it is absolutely critical that all departments, especially the sales teams, are equipped with the right sales tools to plan, predict, and work without any hassle.
Most sales leaders discuss how important digital adoption is to every company, but most of them forget the most critical part - their people!
People may not be the most important digital transformation pillar but, the company will struggle if it does not hire the right people or focus on its staff.
Employees must come first for leaders, and this goes without saying.
This relates to both employee experience and customer experience to nurture, value, and build people's relationships. Businesses that invest in their employees and their well-being, commit to their growth, and value them establish a sense of commitment that makes changes inside the organization a breeze.
Companies ought to remember who they are, with sales technologies entering their workspace, such as AI, VR, machine learning, and more.
Leveraging advanced sales technologies is to implement them in such a way that these technologies will help design memorable experiences that relate to their employees, customers, and others on a deeper level while maintaining human-to-human connections.
To move and become digital first, employees need to be on the same page.
With the recent pandemic forcing businesses to shift from in-person to online, the trends in cyber attacks have been alarming. Here are a few statistics -
Although it's quite a common phrase over the last decade that "every company is a technology company" and, if you're not one, the urge to become a tech-forward company is unparalleled.
To secure technology and practice safe transactions, you want to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack.
To be a highly secure company, be compliant with the most advanced security and privacy certification such as ISO, GDPR, SOC 2, and more, to avoid regular phishing attacks and save not just millions of dollars, but also critical data safe from attackers.
While these skills listed above will help you kickstart your sales skills to be a successful salesperson, to grow in your current role and efficiently advance, it is vital to be consistent.
It's important to learn and be adept with the latest sales job skills to engage, nurture, and delight new types of buyers and upsell your services to them.
Use the skills listed above to craft a unique selling technique that not just helps you stand out in your team, but also drive the sales engine.

Sales success is not just science; it’s a skilful art.
Sales involves a number of tricky variables. There’s a big difference between an average sales performer and a great one. A great salesperson not only hits their goals but also earns loyalty, consistent appreciation and retains their customers.
Bad hires not only prove to be expensive to the organisation.
According to estimates , a bad sales hire costs an organisation 50-75% of the hire’s annual salary. So, if the employee makes $50,000 annually, it costs around $25,000 - $37,500 just to facilitate a suitable replacement.
But there’s also another set of expenses - low productivity, potentially lost business, recruitment costs, and more.
Sales success is not rocket science, but it does involve owning certain skills that help you be the MVP of sales!
Not everyone can handle the high pressure that comes with the job and may quickly end up being stuck in a three-ring circus. Even a highly skilled salesperson can lose the plot sometimes.
Some of the most common reasons contributing to the failure of a salesperson include poor communication skills, a lack of planning, a poor sales script, inadequate product knowledge, inadequate follow-ups, failure to prioritise, steering away from the ideal buyer persona and relying only on manual work as opposed to leveraging automation software.
It’s important to have a growth mindset and remember that the best salespersons aren’t born; they learn, adapt, practice and nurture their skills regularly.
With 92% of all customer interactions happening over a phone call, here are seven key selling habits that will take you a long way.

Oftentimes, for new sales members, tracking the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) can be extremely confusing.
You may find yourself asking what matters, what data points you need to track and what’s truly driving the revenue.
Even an experienced salesperson can sometimes get lost in tracking and creating the right KPIs. KPIs are leading signposts that contribute to being a great salesperson and help you evaluate your performance against your organisational goals.
Sales tools are any digital tools or software that help salespeople close the deal quicker and easier. Investing in the right kind of sales tools can save massive amounts of time spent on manual, repetitive, and administrative tasks. It can also help innovate the selling process itself.
Sales tools such as SalesKen can coach you and your team to navigate every sales conversation intuitively by providing real-time cues, analysing customers’ voices across channels with conversational intelligence, and eliminating lead loss by identifying the customers’ intent, objectives, needs, and context.
In this competitive era, understanding what your competitors are up to and learning their secrets to success is critical to an organisation’s success.
Ignoring this can have serious consequences - loss of market share, jeopardising the business, increased customer retention rate, and even bearing the expenses of low performers.
According to sources, three-quarters of companies state competitive intelligence is crucial to their sales process. Learning the nitty-gritty of your competitors’ offerings is another way of learning about your own. Understanding how their products are being pitched to and used by customers can reveal the potential of your own product.
To sell against your competition, keep these five factors in mind to create a solid foundation for your competitor product training:
A sales strategy is a plan by which you position your product or service in the market and towards your target audience to gain an advantage over the competition. Having the right sales strategy will help you and your team better prioritise and engage with potential customers and close the deal smoothly.
A Forrester study revealed that only 15% of sales calls add enough value. Being well-prepared with your sales calls practices can help you deliver conversations to create a distinctive purchase experience, demonstrate the value of your product, and make you stand out against your competitors.
Here are ten tips to craft a successful sales strategy for you and your team:
Rather than creating a sales strategy that is set in stone, create a strategy that communicates more value in your sales conversations for successful sales.
“Customer experience” is the next competitive battleground. Organisations and sales managers that focus on delivering high-end, smooth product offerings and solutions exclusive to their buyers are the winners at the end of the day.
Personalisation is often the key to bridging the gap to conversion for successful selling of your product. For instance, a sales manager personalising their sales techniques in their email marketing campaigns, cold calls, and even follow-ups, may lead to an increase in responses. This example is backed by data. The research found that 71% of consumers would change the way they interacted with emails if they were personalised.
Here’s how to stand out from the crowd and personalise your message -
Time management and planning is integral to successful selling and is a vital part of your sales training.
Managing time well increases productivity. It prevents the production of poor-quality work, helps meet deadlines, maintains your professional reputation, decreases your stress levels, and more.
Time is the most valuable asset for any sales rep.
Here are a few tips to help you stay focused and declutter:
According to Think Money, a third of the employees are distracted for as many as three hours of the working day. The best way to manage time is to avoid distractions and focus on a single task at a time, giving it your full, undivided attention.
Have an actionable plan to tackle your most important tasks when your productivity is at its peak. Block this time on your calendar and schedule tasks to tick off the list.
Remove, automate, and outsource mundane tasks to help you focus on the critical tasks at hand.
Whether it’s a lead, customer, prospect, or sales rep, it is important to comb out sales success blockers and focus on training and development opportunities.
According to the HubSpot 2021 Sales Enablement Report, 40% of sales leaders missed their revenue targets this year. On the other hand, the sales team that performed well credited adapting their sales needs, using data to focus on the right opportunities and enabling their sales teams with the right tools and technology.
Some of the most common sales success blockers revolve around time management, prioritisation, and efficiency, like not offering real value to prospects, disregarding adaptability, sending out stale sale proposals, lack of skilful coaching and inconsistent sales process.
Identifying and focusing on the right KPIs will help you tackle blockers that keep you and your team from reaching their potential.
There is no one way to achieve success in sales, but there are some tried and tested best practices. Learning on the go, adapting to successful habits and leveraging the right tools and technology are essential to providing a positive sales experience to your customers.

Right after the pandemic hit, sales reps all over the world were forced to adapt virtual selling techniques.
According to the U.S. Census data, there are 5.7 million professional sales professionals in the U.S. alone. As field sales spiked to 52.8%, over 3 million sales reps switched to remote selling roles.
Adapting to a remote-selling environment is not a smooth journey. You have less face-to-face communication with your prospect and most of the conversations happen on emails, chats, or calls. Ineffective interactions are bound to occur. To alleviate this, follow these best practices for cold calling, so you can make the experience worthwhile for your customers and improve your own productivity too!
Being able to tap into human psychology is a gift that top salespersons have in abundance.
Rather than jump right into the pitch, ask questions and listen to discover what the customer is looking for and how you can help them meet their needs. You will quickly learn if your offering fits into their life at all, and if yes, how best it fits in.
No doubt, discounts, free trials, limited period offers, no strings attached and consultation calls all help to encourage reciprocity. But it’s empathy and tapping into your buyer’s psyche that will help you engage with your customers in the most effective way long-term.
Building effective messaging is about tailoring your pitch. The most effective pitches are personalized and customized to the context rather than being one-size-fits-all. They’re also mindful of the mood of the times.
For instance, lockdown is not the time for aggressive messaging. Instead, maintain a soft, caring tone that is empathetic to the present situation of your prospects.
Rather than pushing your agenda, be sensitive to your customer’s needs and moods. Tailor your pitch accordingly. Even if they don’t engage with your business immediately, your customer will remember the friendly, personalized tone of your chat, which will go a long way in cultivating the relationship.
Remote selling is conversational and not just about salespeople giving presentations. Of course, the seller does most of the talking, but you must create an environment that encourages customers to ask questions.
If your client wants to go deeper into the product features, then let them interrupt you! Answer their questions as best as possible. It’s an opportunity to educate them on the product and educate yourself on their needs and preference so you know what to focus on.
To maintain productivity when remote, you need powerful remote working tools.
Begin with your unique problems in mind. Declutter any existing ineffective tools that aren’t adding value to you. When choosing software and tools, consider how they solve your specific challenges. Compare features, pricing, support, and do read online ratings and reviews. Consider free alternatives but don’t hesitate to invest in high-impact areas.
The key is to use the least number of tools, where each tool is high impact. Wherever possible, choose software, tools and platforms that have multiple uses.

Product demos via web conferencing are a bit of extra effort but are highly effective. Here are some tips to ensure a smooth event:
Leverage every opportunity to engage with your prospects. Connect with your prospective customers on social media and engage with them whenever appropriate.
Here are some great ways to network online:
Working remotely has its own perks and distractions.
Working from home may make it especially hard to demarcate work time from downtime, so setting boundaries is key:
Finally, if you’re a manager, don’t assume that everyone has the same environment. Check in with your team to learn how your company can help facilitate the best environment for working from home, to set all teammates up for success.

Right after the pandemic hit, sales reps all over the world were forced to adapt virtual selling techniques.
According to the U.S. Census data, there are 5.7 million professional sales professionals in the U.S. alone. As field sales spiked to 52.8%, over 3 million sales reps switched to remote selling roles.
Adapting to a remote-selling environment is not a smooth journey. You have less face-to-face communication with your prospect and most of the conversations happen on emails, chats, or calls. Ineffective interactions are bound to occur. To alleviate this, follow these best practices for cold calling, so you can make the experience worthwhile for your customers and improve your own productivity too!
Being able to tap into human psychology is a gift that top salespersons have in abundance.
Rather than jump right into the pitch, ask questions and listen to discover what the customer is looking for and how you can help them meet their needs. You will quickly learn if your offering fits into their life at all, and if yes, how best it fits in.
No doubt, discounts, free trials, limited period offers, no strings attached and consultation calls all help to encourage reciprocity. But it’s empathy and tapping into your buyer’s psyche that will help you engage with your customers in the most effective way long-term.
Building effective messaging is about tailoring your pitch. The most effective pitches are personalized and customized to the context rather than being one-size-fits-all. They’re also mindful of the mood of the times.
For instance, lockdown is not the time for aggressive messaging. Instead, maintain a soft, caring tone that is empathetic to the present situation of your prospects.
Rather than pushing your agenda, be sensitive to your customer’s needs and moods. Tailor your pitch accordingly. Even if they don’t engage with your business immediately, your customer will remember the friendly, personalized tone of your chat, which will go a long way in cultivating the relationship.
Remote selling is conversational and not just about salespeople giving presentations. Of course, the seller does most of the talking, but you must create an environment that encourages customers to ask questions.
If your client wants to go deeper into the product features, then let them interrupt you! Answer their questions as best as possible. It’s an opportunity to educate them on the product and educate yourself on their needs and preference so you know what to focus on.
To maintain productivity when remote, you need powerful remote working tools.
Begin with your unique problems in mind. Declutter any existing ineffective tools that aren’t adding value to you. When choosing software and tools, consider how they solve your specific challenges. Compare features, pricing, support, and do read online ratings and reviews. Consider free alternatives but don’t hesitate to invest in high-impact areas.
The key is to use the least number of tools, where each tool is high impact. Wherever possible, choose software, tools and platforms that have multiple uses.

Product demos via web conferencing are a bit of extra effort but are highly effective. Here are some tips to ensure a smooth event:
Leverage every opportunity to engage with your prospects. Connect with your prospective customers on social media and engage with them whenever appropriate.
Here are some great ways to network online:
Working remotely has its own perks and distractions.
Working from home may make it especially hard to demarcate work time from downtime, so setting boundaries is key:
Finally, if you’re a manager, don’t assume that everyone has the same environment. Check in with your team to learn how your company can help facilitate the best environment for working from home, to set all teammates up for success.

A good programmer may not be good at selling, and a person great at sales may not be good at marketing.
This implies that every job requires a specific set of skills to get the job done well.
And sales isn’t an exception.
Selling isn’t an easy feat, and the best sales reps understand this, and are constantly updating and upskilling themselves to stay ahead of the game.
Today’s consumers are more aware than ever before and have multiple options, and sellers will need to be more empathetic, understand the true needs of the consumers and customize the pitch to improve engagement.
Sales reps to be successful, need to be able to build genuine rapport with the consumers and be their friend and advisor without coming across as too salesy.
So, how can a sales rep be more successful? And what qualities and attributes can help them stand out from the rest?
Read on to know more!
In essence, selling skills are the fundamental strategies and processes salespeople must master to incorporate their efforts, that result in a sale.
Salespeople are typically taught through coaching and peer learning, and experience, and are leveraged to a wide variety of prospects on a personal, thoughtful level.
Here are 11 essential qualities that must be followed by sales reps to become a good salesperson in 2023 -
To achieve better sales results, ask questions about your buyer's goals and pain points.
If you're wondering how to become a good salesperson, you need to pay attention to your prospects and customers and be fully present any time you have a conversation with them.
One of the most effective selling tactics is to listen to the customer carefully. This way, you can understand their pain points, challenges, fears, and expectations to connect with them on a personal level and show them that you genuinely want to help them out.
When prospects are relaxed, they typically discuss their actual issues at hand and be open to providing you with all the information. Ask the right questions to move further and understand your prospect better.
A handful of sales reps assume that the fastest way to make a name for yourself in the company is by blowing away your competition.
This approach is not only isolating, but you will also miss out on a lot of bonding and learning. Modern salespeople, regardless of their experience level, must practice and embrace team selling.
Bring in experts such as product managers, senior sales reps, or anyone relevant to the conversation to close more deals. You'll also learn valuable skills along the way, and regularly meet your quota at the end of each quarter.
It's a win-win!
The most important quality to imbibe is to build long-lasting relationships with customers.
As a good sales rep, your goal must be to help the customer and get the results they want. Remember that customers are less interested in your product but more inclined towards the results your product can help them achieve.
Your product may only help them solve a part of their problem; but you can help them solve other parts, too.
Sales reps need to understand the product’s USP, benefits, features, competitor’s products’ weaknesses and effectively communicate to the lead. It is essential for the reps to know all the sales collaterals inside-out to ensure that they don’t undersell or oversell the product benefits, and ensure long term customer retention.
Organizations typically have sales enablement content and collateral to ensure consistent messaging and positioning of the product at every stage of the customer journey and touch point.
But, a good sales rep must be able to tweak and add in a more personalized touch to the communication to ensure maximum success.
In sales, dealing with objections and roadblocks is inevitable, and also, challenging for most sales reps.
Objection handling is an art and the process entails following specific actions and skills that involve a bit of learning. Some soft skills to learn to manage objections easily are -
In general, objection handling requires a certain level of deftness. It requires a level of product, industry knowledge, and prospect background to handle.
This insinuates that knowing how to overcome objections respectfully and with compassion, even in unexpected situations, is a must.
This sales quality is one of the most important and leading qualities of inbound sales.
Marketing teams spend most of their time pushing out leads in the sales funnel, however, not all the leads they send are relevant to your product.
This is the power of inbound marketing.
Create and curate high-quality and highly relevant content for prospects to genuinely help them with the issues they are facing, and let them come to you. This not only brings in high-quality leads to the funnel but also improves your chances of closing a sale.
Technology is a crucial part of the sales process.
Modern-day customers are highly evolved and purchasing trends have drastically changed over the years. Applying the sales tactics of 2011 with the hopes of increasing sales volume in 2023 will most definitely not work.
Understanding and implementing the latest sales technologies such as sales automation, sales enablement, and optimization is the key to not just improving as a sales rep but also running your business more effectively.
Automation tools make sales reps live much easier, giving them the leeway to actually focus on making a sale, as opposed to spending half their time doing administrative tasks.
Tech-savvy customers know who exactly to purchase from without even going through an endless list of options if they feel their needs are not catered to.
Ensure you leverage the right technology to make the sales process seamless.
The most successful sales reps have clear goals and are constantly updating and upskilling themselves to ensure career progression.
They are aware of the industry trends (both theirs and their buyer’s), know their competitors inside out, are aware of the buyer’s needs and concerns, and personalize the pitch to improve engagements.
Also, successful sales reps network to build relationships within the seller’s community and are open to learning from both practitioners and other sources.
Their willingness to learn, clear career goals and perseverance, and patience, and sales reps put them on the path to success.
The saying, "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer", could not be more true in this context.
Regardless of how evolved your product may be, learning about your competitors in the market is absolutely necessary to succeed.
To learn about your competitors, you need to do a SWOT analysis of your competitors. Read through review aggregators like G2, TrustRadius, Software Reviews and other online communities, and know how your competitors are viewed by the market.
“Your competitor is charging 30% lower as compared to you” - this is one of the most common objections you’ll face when talking to the leads, and you need to be in a position to clearly articulate the benefits of your product and explain how you deliver better ROIs than your competitors.
This can only come from thorough research and knowing your competitors inside-out.
The sales world is practically different than any other profession.
As a successful sales rep, you must constantly be on the lookout to learn new skills, whilst chasing monthly and quarterly quotas and goals - this can, indeed, be quite stressful.
To make this easier, talk to people from your network to understand how they upskill themselves, and how their positions function and be wary of current trends to get a general sense of the skills you should be focusing on to be successful.
Be consistently active on social media channels such as LinkedIn and Twitter to connect with peers and leaders from your industry. This way, you're always up to date and can move progressively further in your career.
Critical thinking is a necessity in most occupations, and sales are no different.
Critical thinking entails decision-making, problem-solving, and a myriad of ranges of thinking possibilities to resolve issues, close deals, and push forward prospects in the sales cycle.
With critical thinking, sales reps can solve any customer challenges with ease.
To promote critical thinking when selling, follow these quick tips -
Sales is a complicated business.
And competent sales persons can improve the sales processes of any sales team by bringing in their own perspectives and constantly innovating and improving outcomes.
To become a good sales rep in 2023, you need to be driven, committed, and highly passionate. To put it in simple words, to be a successful sales rep, you need to work smarter.
Although we're slowly inching back towards adjusting to the new normal, do not allow it to obstruct your sales goals and hamper your success. Sales success, truly, comes down to being tuned into the market, being an expert in your niche, constantly learning, and asking the right questions.
Although we discuss a lot about B2B and B2C, at the end of it, you're selling to people - people who are experiencing roadblocks and people who cannot solve them.

The landscape of sales in 2023 is drastically shifted from traditional sales methods to varied methods of sales that directly impacts organizations.
Today, owing to a decline in profit margins, market trends, and cut throat competition, businesses are perceiving at sales and marketing models that are less cost-prohibitive and own higher closing rates as compared to traditional sales methods.
Naturally, organizations are now adopting inside sales or digital sales to reduce their costs while engaging their customers to build better relationships with interactive technology.
And thus, the demand for inside sales representative is on the rise, indicating a massive opportunity to learn.
So, what is inside sales and why must sales representatives learn the secret of the trade?
In this blog, you'll learn about -
Let's dive in.
The growth of technology, and improvements in communication has reduced the need for salespersons to meet the leads face-to-face and inside sales (or selling remotely) is slowly becoming the most dominant mode of selling.
Inside sales is the act of selling things in a remote environment, without actually meeting the customer in person or at their premises.
Here, communication is done primarily via phone, emails or social media and other digital channels.
Inside Sales is cost-effective, and it allows the teams to personalize the buying journey of the customers at scale.
Today, an increasing number of organizations are adapting inside sales strategy to ensure that they are accessing the maximum potential of their inside sales teams.
The upsurge around the activities of inside sales is a direct result of the converging influence of competition, schedules, budgets, advancements in social selling, and other sales and marketing automation tools.
These efficiencies around inside sales help sales people to reach out to customers in a cost-effective way.
An inside sales representative is a type of salesperson that works remotely or within an office to assist potential clients find what they are actively looking for.
Unlike other sales reps, inside sales representatives spend most of their day on the telephone, or writing emails, or other digital channels to not only assist customers but also deploy great sales strategies to close deals.
When a sales rep is hired, the expectations around their skillset varies from generating leads, creating sales pitches, hitting sales quotas, and generating revenue.
Acquiring, learning, and mastering sales skills can help you become better at your workplace and close more deals. Here are 12 most important sales skills to master -
Sales representatives must possess strong communication skills to build better customer relationship, and this doesn't necessarily limit to just talking abilities.
Possessing active listening skills means hearing out your customers and finding out what's best for them. Regardless of in-person selling or cold calling prospects, it is absolutely vital to let your customers talk.
Most times, your buyers willingly share their pain points, if you let them.
For an inside sales representative, having absolute product knowledge is a very important skill to have.
There's nothing worse than forgetting your core product features when on a demo with a potential customer. Or, how about when you field a product question you should know the answer to and miss an opportunity to highlight a star feature to a specific use-case?
Unimaginable, right?
Although some of these situations are inevitable in daily sales conversations and for new joiners, these type of mistakes can be solved in most cases by just understanding your product in various ways.
Thus, before finishing your sales training, it's vital you have detailed product knowledge of the features, advantages, benefits, use-cases, examples, and more.
Else, you will have immense difficulty selling your sales pitch to individual use-cases and helping prospects with the right features for their needs.
Not just that, this sales skill of having in-depth product knowledge also comes with an added benefit of establishing yourself as a product and domain expert, too.
Empathy enables your sales representatives to tune into verbal and non-verbal cues, and have a deep understanding of the client's emotions and feelings.
Having empathy is an important sales skill that helps salespeople to fully comprehend their customers' pain points, worries, and fears. As a result, salespeople can create enhanced emotional connections and build long-term relationships with their customers.
Prospects do not want to purchase from someone who doesn't consider their feelings and opinions. A great salesperson does not only sympathize when their customer shares their fears, but also deeply understands them beyond their pain points.
Contrary to common misconception, empathy is not a fixed skillset, it can be learned.
Develop and train your sales team with this skill by outlining the importance of empathy, how to develop this skill, and how it impacts your sales representatives' performance.
At the end of the day, the effectiveness of a sales rep is calculated by your sales productivity, the amount of revenue you generate, and the number of hours you worked.
If time management is a difficult area for you and sways your focus away, leverage an intuitive CRM, or a sales intelligent platform like Salesken to automate routine tasks. This helps you focus on actually selling and not spending hours together on admin tasks.
Do not forget that your prospects' time is equally important, too.
Stay respectful of the time your potential customer is giving you and personalize your conversation in a way to strike a balance between showing genuine interest by not wasting their time.
It is an ubiquitous fact that a sales representative spends most of their time during the day communicating.
Right from sending emails to holding meetings, making phone calls, and even using live chats - a sales representative leverages several channels to communicate their needs.
Possessing great communication skills is crucial for being a great salesperson. Having an effective and reliable tool to collaborate with your team and contact your prospects is a must.
Customers don't just listen to the content you say, but also observe your tone, listening skills, speed of talking, and the intimate knowledge you possess about the product.
In the world of sales and marketing, communication is the cardinal.
To polish your communication skills with your customers, ensure you are -
It is a common myth that only great salespeople are born with great storytelling.
As an inside sales representative, you may come across several cold calling pitches and email templates to help you boost your closing rate.
By continually educating yourself and learning the best sales techniques from your peers, you can level and upskill yourself.
Buyers do not really want to hear about your service and good sales people are already aware of this. Learning and mastering the art of weaving a story into your sales pitch that has an arc and ends with an 'aha' moment for the customer is really what sells the product.
The ultimate goal of relationship building is to simply build trust with your customer.
Although there's been a lot of chatter about relationship selling over the years, the ability to build relationships with your prospects will always remain as the core sales skills to master.
Simply put, relationship building is your ability to effectively engage with your sales team, and work to establish a level of connection that can last beyond just quick transactions and pitches.
More importantly, these customer relationships, when built genuinely on a foundation of providing high-value upfront without the expectation of an immediate transaction - can lead to exciting opportunities such as referrals, higher customer satisfaction, and excellent customer service.
A CRM, or a customer relationship management tool can easily become one of the most powerful tool for high-performing organizations and sales leaders, if you allow it to be.
A CRM has a myriad of capabilities to assist you with everyday activities and help you close more sales. Within the context of the functionality of your sales process, are you getting the maximum out of your current CRM?
If the answer is no, it's time to revisit your process.
If a CRM can deliver automated email sequences to new leads when they enter your sales funnel, freeing up hours of routine tasks for you - this change alone can save you hours of your time in a week.
Learning how to correctly use the features of your CRM to expedite your sales process and sales activities will help you greatly improve the efficiency.
Choose a CRM that has the following features -
An inside sales representative job is more than just picking up the phone to call a potential customer, or shooting emails - they also need to thoroughly understand and find out crucial details about their leads and their needs to increase the chances to closing more sales.
A good inside sales representative undertake research.
By analyzing and understanding your product in-depth, you can effectively explain every feature successfully.
With research, it is also vital to understand that inside sales representatives find out about who and why your potential customers would be interested in your pitch.
As exciting as it might be to just pick up your phone and dial that number, it is equally important to do your due diligence.
Ensure you gather enough information about your leads, how your product will be useful for them, and tailor the conversation accordingly.
Research the market, potential customers, use-cases of your product, and how you can reward your customers.
In this day, social selling is of great significance.
As important as it is, many companies are missing the mark with social media skills.
To make a great ISR, it is crucial you have a good grasp of social media. Most information about your lead is available publicly, thus, learning how to acquire and use this information will help you in getting their attention well.
However, you should not forget that your leads are researching you, too and it's highly likely that they know a lot about you, too.
Some of the best salespeople have great social skills and leverage it to organize dinners, hold effective meetings, carry out meaningful conversations, and hit their sales goals.
Say you have done all the job related to capturing an interest in your product from a promising lead, however, simply obtaining qualified and enthusiastic leads is not enough.
As an inside sales representative, it is important to not come across as extremely pushy, but you need to learn the art of contacting your prospects regularly in a way to improve chances of conversion.
This is why highly successful sales reps plan their follow-up calls to close more sales over time.
Follow-up with your prospects through automated emails and calls to keep them in the loop and help them stay warm. Depending on the way they receive the follow-up, decide on a strategy to further personalize your efforts.
A good way for an inside sales representative to stay on track with following up is to set up reminders for emails and daily calls to remain on schedule and help you hit your sales goals effectively.
One of the biggest concerns most organizations have when setting up their sales team is whether to focus on inside sales vs outside sales.
With the onset of the pandemic, most salespeople are working remotely. As we have progressed forward to a world that feels more normal, which model do companies default to?
To make things simpler, inside sales refers to sales made within an office, or a remote set-up via phone, email, social media, and other digital channels.
Inside sales, also called as remote sales, is not done face-to-face.
Whereas, outside sales on the other hand, involves sales reps traveling outside their office to the prospect's location to sell a service face-to-face.
Here's a quick breakdown to help you visualize the structure of an inside sales model vs outside sales model -
Inside sales, is undoubtedly, challenging.
In day-to-day sales activities, you may face several obstacles that make it difficult to help you meet your sales quotas.
Here are some of the challenges that you may face in your inside sales career -
In the modern day, a business of any niche may have several competitors.
With an increasing number of competitors arising, there's also a massive increase in competition.
Inside sales representatives find it extremely challenging to find new prospects and retain them, especially with this shift in the working environment.
Tip - Research your competitors using new tools and understand their USPs to analyze your competitive advantage.
Sales reps receive a high number of leads everyday.
However, not every lead will convert and sometimes, they may not even match your ideal profile.
Prospecting and qualifying the right leads is imperative and this can be a primary obstacle towards closing deals.
Tip - Work in tandem with the sales and marketing teams to getting high-quality leads. Jot down your ideal customer profile correctly to target the right lead and pass it on to the sales team.
With having to do a number of tasks everyday, sales reps usually complain they do not have enough time to do all their tasks.
While nurturing leads, making cold calls, following-up, scheduling meetings, and more, inside sales representatives lose a chunk of their time throughout the day.
Tip - Invest in a good quality CRM to reduce administrative tasks as much as possible and help your inside sales representatives to focus on other essential tasks to help them close more deals.
Although inside sales may seem like an ocean with a myriad of tips, techniques, and core skills to possess, the learning field is endless.
Inside sales representatives are powerful agents who leverage their time on acquiring leads, conducting research, and following supreme customer service.
Honing these 11 important inside sales representative skills will help you move seamlessly in any organization and achieve maximum success as an ISR.

When done right, follow-up calls are a brilliant way to seal the deal. They play an important part in the sales process.
But why are follow-ups so effective? Proper follow-up calls help you keep your prospects engaged. You can openly communicate with them and keep the conversations going. This, in turn, increases your chances of closing a deal successfully.
However, most sales representatives (44% to be exact) give up after making the first call. But 80% of successful deals require at least five follow-ups and several calls.
This post is all about making follow-up calls. So, if you are thinking about making a follow-up sales call perfectly, explore the tips we have listed!
Setting up a perfect follow-up call requires some homework. Get some information about your prospect, and then try out these five strategies.
As we said, prepare for your call beforehand. For a sales call, note down the probable questions that your prospect or client might ask and prepare the answers. The same goes for follow-up calls on an inquiry or complaint. Once you prepare the answers, the chances of fumbling are less. You sound more convincing and confident.
Calls during busy hours can get annoying. So, to avoid calling at the wrong time, it’s always a good idea to schedule your calls. This way, you can save your time and make the most out of telephonic conversations. Also, both you and your client will be ready for the call.
While you might have several questions, listen first. To make your conversation meaningful, strike a balance between speaking and listening. If you don’t bother to actively listen and engage, the client will lose interest after some time. Also, provide time for the client to respond. Be comfortable with silence and let them think about their answer.
The success of your follow-up call depends on the questions you ask. Go for open-ended questions and avoid leading the client’s answers. So, before that scheduled sales call back, prepare a list of questions you can ask the prospect.
Two things keep good follow-up calls going: getting clarifications of responses and reiterating these responses to ensure that you understand the client. This removes the possibility of misunderstandings and can lead to higher client satisfaction.
So, the next time you make that follow-up courtesy call, ensure you set yourself up for the most perfect, most successful call possible first!
Stressing about how to do a follow-up is going to lead you nowhere. So, relax and apply these tried and tested tips for the perfect follow-up call.
Sales teams must plan their follow-up call at the end of sales calls. Ask your client about the next step. Then understand their interest and suggest your action plan.
Brief them about how you will be reaching out, for instance, through the phone. If the prospect confirms the next interaction, they can fix a date and time for the call.
At the end of a call, ask your prospect how you can stay in contact with them. Get to know the best way to reach them out.
Also, list a few reasons why staying in touch with you would be beneficial. For instance, provide solution briefs and decks, industry details or competitor analysis.
Understand how your prospect prefers to communicate. You don’t want to bombard them with calls when they prefer emails.
After your discovery call, ask your prospect their preferred mode of communication. This takes you a step further to working with them.
Ask them what would work the best – a call, text, or a sales follow-up email. After that, confirm when to follow the call next.
Ask the prospect - ‘When would be the best time for a follow-up? Can you make some time within a week?’
Such questions always get you a relevant answer without sounding aggressive.
Figure out what you are trying to achieve with the client. Jot down the steps and follow them. This way, you can prepare for your next step accordingly.
If your conversation goes well, lock in a date and time for the next follow-up call. If your client commits to taking the next step, you can be sure of re-engaging them.
Whether you make a follow-up call, text, or email, ensure you specify a good reason behind it.
For example, if you send a follow-up email, put in some helpful information for the client, like any relevant industry news from Google alerts. Such personalisations in follow-ups go a long way.
Similarly, tell your client why you have called when making a follow-up call. Prepare your reasons beforehand to ensure a smooth conversation.
After your call or meeting, send an email that summarizes the entire conversation. This practice has several benefits:
You can use such emails as a reference in the long run. Also, it means that you really did engage your client or prospect well!
A little extra effort opens up a lot of possibilities. When dealing with a prospect, make sure to send them a thank you note after every call.
‘Thank you, David, for taking out the time to speak with me. I look forward to our meeting on 18th.’
A short ‘thank you’ message creates a certain degree of equity, making you different from the other salespeople.
The day before your follow-up courtesy call, send an email to your prospect to remind them of the appointment. This email can be a reminder and should also include your next call agenda. By agenda, we mean your point of discussion in the next call.
Remember to use a slightly casual tone (business casual) to make your prospect feel comfortable over the call.
Sales teams can use sales analytics software like Salesken to maintain a closer look at the sales team’s performance. A speech analytics software will help you with:
Perfecting a follow-up call requires a salesperson to be persistent, patient, and polite. In short, a thorough professional.
Avoid nagging the prospect if they aren’t responding. Leave a message so that they know you had called up on time. Wait for their response for 10-15 minutes. If you do not receive any, leave another message asking them to call you back when convenient.
A perfect follow-up can happen in a few different ways, as each salesperson can blend in their ways of interaction. However, following best practices can help you win half the battle. So, use these tips and combine them with your confidence. Nothing can stop you from getting that deal right!
Sales follow-up calls can work as a relationship-building exercise with prospects. Before making any purchase, prospects look for credibility. With sales follow-up calls, reps can stay in touch and increase their changes of closing the deal.
Sales reps should never push the prospects with frequent sales follow-up calls. There should be a minimum period of a wait before making a sales follow-up call. For example, if you had a meeting with the prospect on Tuesday, you can send them a reminder about it on Monday. Also, after 24-hours of the meeting, you can give another follow-up call to the prospect to discuss the next steps.
When following up with prospects, sales reps should be able to perform an intent analysis of the prospect quickly. Reps should not spend their valuable time on a prospect who has very low intent to buy the product. Salesken can analyse conversations between reps and prospects to perform a quick intent analysis of the prospects. Hence, it becomes easier to decide which prospect to follow up with.

Sales Insight
With the advent of covid, NBC bank was in the process of re-orienting its entire banking strategy. The physical banking in branches was riddled with inefficiencies over travel time, lack of experts who could address customer queries over very specific products and long sales cycles. Meanwhile, the customer behavior trend was moving away from bank in person visits to phone banking or internet banking. To navigate these changes and fix the sales inefficiencies, NBC bank set up a virtual customer banking team that would do both cold calls for new customers as well as service calls to existing customers. Eventually, this team scaled to about 10,000 relationship managers (“RMs” i.e. sellers).
The overall funnel conversions were less than 1% and NBC bank wanted to improve the overall productivity of the RMs. At that point of time, NBC bank used Microsoft Dynamics as the CRM and Genesys as their dialer.
NBC bank engaged Salesken to:
a) Improve RM productivity through call analytics on gaps in the RM customer conversations and
b) provide real time assistance through live cues
Salesken was integrated with Genesys to pull dual channel live audio streams from the dialer and was also integrated with Microsoft Dynamics to get lead information. Salesken was hosted on Microsoft Azure and a browser extension based cue box was deployed that would pop up open on the desktop during the call. A mobile version of the Salesken app was also deployed with Salesken’s own telephony, where the cues would pop-up on the phone.
Calls were received and analyzed in real time and cues were deployed that would help assist NBC bank sellers in real-time.
Salesken initially started the engagement with 300 users and analyzed the calls for 1 month. The key analytic findings, that were presented during the customer success review meetings revealed the following:
Salesken’s sales AI models analyzed NBC bank RM’s pitch on various dimensions relevant to the pitch:
65% of the calls were selling the wrong product to the customers and not engaging the customers on the stated intent.
70% of calls did not handle objections successfully. There were big gaps, especially on competitor or product related objections
NBC bank’s sales calls were also analyzed on soft elements of selling.
97% of the calls had no consultative selling from the RMs.
83% of calls had scored 0 on empathy at any time during the call.
Looking at the Salesken Analysis NBC bank concluded the following:
Cues were delivered at an average rate of 8 cues per call. RMs could be auto cued or custom cued depending on the areas they wanted assistance on. 85% of the RMs chose assistance on product cues and objection handling cues.
The impact on NBC bank’s sales conversation was quite dramatic.
As an outcome of these dramatic improvements, NBC bank signed up a 3 year contract with Salesken for 10,000 RMs which has been fully delivered. Real time cues are an integral part of the sellers onboarding training and workflow.
The improvements in the seller's conversation pre and post Salesken were as below:
Salesken analytics was integrated into the bank's analytics. Customer intent data was used by product teams to enhance their product recommendation.
Salesken continues to support NBC bank and since then replicated this use case across 3 other banks, multiple insurance and SaaS customers. Salesken has processed several 100s of millions minutes of conversation data into successful customer engagements and revenue.

You already knew that artificial intelligence can drive cars, but did you know that it can also drive sales?
That is because artificial intelligence has changed nearly everything and sales are no exception.
AI tools fuel our buying choices every day - right from our favorite voice assistants to watching our favorite shows, it's everywhere!
Artificial intelligence is playing a major role in most organizations and forward-thinking companies are catching on to it.
And, in sales, the need to automate admin and non-sales activity is vital.
AI in sales can help you increase your time spent on selling activities by automating administrative tasks and analyzing your everyday work to help you improve overall productivity.
But first, what is artificial intelligence for sales? How can it help sales teams to sell more?
In this guide, we'll discuss -
Let's dive in.
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a blanket term that covers a myriad of technologies like machine learning, NLP, NLU & NLG, computer vision, deep learning, and more.
At their core, all of the technologies mentioned assist machines perform specific cognitive tasks as well as, or better than human involvement.
When it comes to sales, AI is not just used to sort out tons of data generated by sales teams can be leveraged by teams to make data-driven decisions with features such as sentiment analysis, enhanced customer service, automate repetitive tasks, and more.
Sales managers can now make accurate predictions, recommendations, and decisions backed by data to boost your revenue.
For profitable businesses, artificial intelligence for sales teams means a greater ability to organize mountains of eye-opening data in real-time and use it again to gain deeper insights into customer data and buying habits.
Although some important decisions can be left to an actual human salesperson, such as reading body language, navigating complex-decision making, and interpreting customers' tone of voice.
However, artificial intelligence only expedites this process giving more room for sales teams to focus on making a sale.
These functions could range from retrieving purchase history, and social media activities, to drafting emails with templates, market trends, and more.
Additionally, AI tools can also help in revenue forecasting, analyzing customer behavior, identifying leads with high purchase intent based on their interaction with the brand, and uncovering other relevant insights on customers that can help personalize their buying experience.
The role of AI in sales is to leverage data analysis algorithms to handle cognitive work that is too heavy for sales teams to actually handle on their own.
It also means less human involvement and reliance on human intervention, which can be hard to retain in traditional sales teams.
Now, this brings us to the next part - why does AI play a vital role in sales?
Sales managers are perpetually looking to optimize performance to achieve optimum results, and this is where artificial intelligence and machine learning tools come into play.
On the sales side, AI is all about accelerating the sales cycle, sales tracking, and making more room for more productive interactions.
However, contrary to what people think, artificial intelligence is not going to replace human reps. In fact, it can help sales teams quite a lot.
It gives sales reps the right insights and tools to work smarter and form better relationships with potential customers and existing customers, boosting their ability to reach their sales goals.
By handing over excessive data-driven tasks to AI tools, sales teams can have more time to develop and reap the awards for their individual selling skills.
An intelligent sales organization can be proactive instead of reactive to navigate the ever-changing market landscape.
Different data types require different variations of AI tools.
Here are four types of AI for sales teams used across industries globally -
AI analytics is a tool that takes a deep dive into your raw sales data to interpret patterns for sales organizations to make data-backed decisions.
AI analytics can detect anomalies and alert you in real-time and save data analysts hours of time and help you increase sales.
Businesses typically handle a lot of data to use for different purposes, and AI analytics aids sales personnel and helps in closing deals more often.
Natural language processing or, NLP, is designed to understand and interpret to respond naturally to human speech - written and verbal - in the most human-like manner.
With the help of computational linguistics, NLP not only endeavors to understand the human language being used, but also interprets the intentions and sentiment analysis behind the words.
NLP is a tool that most people have interacted with in the past - this AI technology is already being leveraged to innovate digital voice assistants, speech-to-text programs, and customer service chatbots.
Smart process automation, or SPA, is robotic automation with machine learning.
SPA identifies the need for human intervention during an automated process in order to take the next ideal step forward to enhance overall sales performance.
It loops human counterparts into the sales process, and then uses human-made decisions to predict solutions for similar circumstances in the future.
Smart process automation is not an entirely human-free tool but still counts as AI because of its machine learning properties that make it more efficient over time.
Predictive analytics is a type of artificial intelligence tool that tries to estimate what may happen in the future.
The tool has the capacity to do so by identifying the factors that influence a predictive outcome and understanding the process to do so.
This feature is from diagnostic analytics which tries to explain the reasoning behind why something happens. Sales forecasting typically leans on predictive analytics models to advise sales pipeline planning.
This form of analytics uses optimization techniques to recommend the best course of action when a complex decision involves hindrances between business constraints and objectives.
Also known as a recommender system, this type of AI-powered tool can identify and suggest cross-selling and upselling opportunities to sellers and sales managers.
AI systems with automation are a great tool to gather data, storing excessive data from other channels such as CRMs, and other sales supporting tools in your tech stack.
By gathering the correct data, and ensuring it is organized and interconnected correctly, you can leverage machine learning and AI to uncover trends, improve the marketing landscape of your company, and highlight customer opportunities.
Apart from that, here are 7 primary ways to leverage AI for sales to boost your revenue engine for high-performing teams -
The art of selling can be a hit or miss.
A sales team can spend all their time trying to sell to leads who do not care about your product/service, and when this happens, the entire blame cannot be shifted to the salesperson alone.
As a result of this, it is inevitable that 75% of the leads are a waste of time.
The lack of sufficient data on leads typically leaves sales teams clutching at straws.
Organizations struggle to make an impact in their niche without a solid market and customer intelligence. However, with data, these dynamics can shift.
Take things up a notch by instructing your sales teams to track prospects and existing customers' online activities, via an AI-powered CRM. This way, you can have hands-on better references to understand your targeted prospects better and sell better.
Leveraging AI technology enables sales reps to reach verdicts based on lead scoring from the tool. This data-driven approach has a net effect of improving sales productivity.
Having an AI tool allows you to have more accurate results and engage leads in real-time before assigning them to the right sales rep to guide them along the sales funnel.
Personalization is not just a buzzword in the world of sales and it surely is not a passing fad too.
Personalization works; modern customers, in fact, expect personalization, and thus, the generic sales and marketing landscape is now obsolete.
Statistics prove just this.
Although AI isn't overly necessary for personalization, it assists your sales teams to deliver a hyper-relevant, unique customer experience to every individual.
Sales predictions and sales forecast accuracy are crucial for any organization.
It supports future decisions with realistic expectations, right from resource allocation and analyzing the chances of prospect conversion, to even understanding your existing product features.
Artificial intelligence helps sales managers understand the current trends and their path to meeting sales goals every quarter and prioritize prospects that have a high tendency to convert with sales prediction and forecasting.
If your team is still using excel sheets, emails, or Slack messages, it's time to shift to an intuitive AI tool that helps you unravel the story behind every deal.
AI-enabled organizations accurately forecast and plan accordingly.
With AI, a sales rep can -
AI enabled forecasting, elicits value by providing teams with real-time insights that can be leveraged to develop winning sales strategy, especially for sales managers.
Accordingly, this helps them to personalize their sales coaching and training to specific individual sales reps and thus, improve their sales attribution based on factual numbers.
Identifying promising leads is only part of a sales representative's homework.
Regardless of the industry your product/service specializes in, providing round-the-clock customer service is essential.
Chatbots are ubiquitous in the modern sales landscape.
Despite the reluctance of some customers towards this technology, they are already interacting with it on a daily basis in some capacity.
AI-powered chatbots are not just voiced assistants for smartphones - they have features beyond that, which help companies improve their customer service.
Customer service chats based chatbots, that is, artificial intelligence has the capacity to converse with the buyer, can clarify doubts and questions about your product, consult stock, make suggestions, and even complete the purchase and payment process.
AI-based chatbots have become an integral part of a company's tech stack as they offer 24/7 service and increase their agility by answering short and easy-to-solve queries.
In addition, in time, they learn to respond to prospects in the most human-like manner, thus, completely reducing the need for human involvement during the sales process.
It is a well known fact that it is easier to retain than gain a new customer. And AI can analyze customer behavior and red flag churn signs.
For instance, if a customer is repeatedly getting stuck using a particular feature or isn’t using all the features or using the product for far fewer time than others, it is a clear sign that they aren’t finding enough value in the product, and are likely to churn.
Similarly, AI can determine the usage pattern, and identify if the customer is ready to upgrade to multiple other features or to buy more, leading to higher revenues.
Instead of counting on your sales representatives to just wing it, AI tools, in fact, has the capacity to streamline your sales processes and automate workflows.
Task delegation and lead prioritization are going to be a breeze with automation.
AI systems do a phenomenal job at boosting your sales representatives' productivity because it does not just identify the most promising leads, but also allocate the best reps, automate repetitive tasks, alert the right sales enablement content to pass on, and more.
The analytical aspect of AI systems is crucial for any high-performing team because it has the ability to figure out which strategies work as opposed to the ones that do not.
As part of the decision-making process, these features will assist you to source reliable reports on the best course of action and deciding on the ones that need to be implemented across the organization.
Predictive analytics has proved to be an invaluable tool for sales management. With predictive analytics, sales managers can get accurate sales forecasts and deep insights to help them structure their sales teams, and thus close more deals.
With AI-powered tools, you can get -
AI comes in many shapes, forms, sizes, and applications.
Right from search queries, to gaming, and personalization to intuitive document recognition - we use artificial intelligence without even knowing it.
In recent years, however, the number of applications and fields where AI and machine learning are prominent has continued to grow with ample use-cases.
But, what about sales?
AI-powered tools such as CRMs, chatbots, sales intelligent tools, and more, help companies nurture a healthy relationship with their customers, understand customer behavior better, respond to their queries, give you deep insights, and more.
Here are four examples of AI in sales in the real world -
Walmart has deployed AI in all its physical stores to assist its employees in running all their stores in a hassle-free manner without any interruptions.
By employing video cameras, sensors and other tech, employees can be alerted when the stocks run low, and they can suitably stack in the rows to ensure the product never runs out. This eliminates the need for employees to manually inspect every aisle, and improves efficiency.
Image processing and visual data could drastically improve the productivity of offline stores. By deploying AI tools in all workspaces, artificial intelligence can efficiently manage inspections that can go unnoticed by humans.
We're already aware of the many AI-related applications that Apple devices come with.
In 2019, Apple acquired several capabilities to improve its processes: -
Artificial intelligence presents business with an opportunity to personalize the buying experience like no other.
Personalization is the key to unparalleled service. By understanding customer behavior deeply with the help of sentiment analysis, real-time cues, and more, organizations can elevate their service to improve their customer interactions drastically.
Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Company, GUARD partnered with an AI data platform to improve and automate its underwriting process for its SMB segment.
The partnership reduced the time spent by underwriters in collecting information on customer profiles.
By structuring customer data in an efficient way, the organization hopes to drastically reduce the time it takes to process a sales cycle.
This example illustrates the vital role played by AI in drawing insights from customer data.
Irrespective of whether the organization is an enterprise or a budding start-up, AI-powered tools speed up the process and bring in greater efficiency.
Last year, the publicly-traded US government Fannie Mae enterprise partnered with Moogsoft to deploy the AIOps platform across their organization for enterprise monitoring.
Once trained, AI tools can continually improve by learning from their past interactions, which means that the ROI of your company grows continually with time.
This also explains why a lot of companies consistently adopt AI with such urgency.
Artificial intelligence applications in sales have a powerful ability to get better over time and thus, enhance the overall sales processes.
It is typical for industry thought leaders and analysts to shine a flashlight on a particular technology and wonder whether salespeople will be replaced by it, and for good cause.
This happened in the early 2000s when email marketing was being adopted by large companies. The predictions were that this technology would, among other things, replace sales reps.
Of course, that didn't happen.
Similarly, with AI and machine learning, the technology will never replace human sales reps.
Such messages sound alarming. According to research by Forrester, AI and machine learning tools only aid in the growth of salespeople.
Salespeople will not become obsolete, but their need to perform repetitive tasks will.
The way we buy, sell, and interact is changing constantly. Today's sales technology equipped with artificial intelligence only transforms the process to make it hassle-free and seamless.
The ability to automate routine tasks, and improve the sales process to give sales professionals more freedom and time to perform selling activities is exactly why AI in sales will flourish.
Although sales are traditionally a people-to-people business, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are dismantling how expert sellers think to establish a fine balance between humans and machines.
Automation is already making tremendous waves in the field of sales and its influence will only continue to grow.
In addition, artificial intelligence accelerates sales processes and helps sales professionals focus on outcome-based optimization with data.
An AI-powered tool can automate daunting processes such as manual data entry, administrative tasks, lead generation, profiling, and scoring, and optimize the sales pipeline to generate more leads and bring in more revenue.
Here are eight ways AI will transform sales in the future -
While a superhuman sales team cannot be completely replaced by a machine, it can be made stronger and more capable with the help of technology.
AI has a ton of promise and the opportunities for growth seem boundless.
Artificial intelligence is being heavily adopted by forward-thinking companies because it offers great convenience to both buyers and sellers.
With its potential to streamline workflows, personalize solutions, and predict the best course of action for closing deals, AI in sales is indeed a powerful tool for increasing sales revenue and setting the stage for long-term success.
Sales leaders need to decide right now where they plan to be on the adoption curve of AI.
First adapters and close followers will more likely experience benefits while lagging companies stand to benefit from the lessons learned from not switching to AI sooner.

Regardless of the model your business follows, AI for sales can transform the way your business operates. AI can increase selling hours, automate repetitive tasks, analyze customer behavior, improve productivity, and more to increase overall sales deals.

For salespeople, AI in sales helps them automate mundane tasks, sales forecasting, lead generation, data-packed reports, and more. For marketers, AI enables scalable growth, drives revenue, personalization, organization of data, and accurate prospect hunting to excel in their roles by engaging with their audience through highly relevant and targeted messaging.
AI augments sales operations but does not replace them. It reduces administrative tasks giving sellers more time to prospect, look for new revenue, and upsell existing clients.
AI for sales is useful for companies to look at AI through the lens of business capabilities as opposed to technologies.
AI can support three primary needs - Automating business processes, engaging customers and sales reps, and gaining insights through data analysis.
‍
AI and machine learning have improved efficiency and accuracy with reduced wastage of resources.

You already knew that artificial intelligence can drive cars, but did you know that it can also drive sales?
That is because artificial intelligence has changed nearly everything and sales are no exception.
AI tools fuel our buying choices every day - right from our favorite voice assistants to watching our favorite shows, it's everywhere!
Artificial intelligence is playing a major role in most organizations and forward-thinking companies are catching on to it.
And, in sales, the need to automate admin and non-sales activity is vital.
AI in sales can help you increase your time spent on selling activities by automating administrative tasks and analyzing your everyday work to help you improve overall productivity.
But first, what is artificial intelligence for sales? How can it help sales teams to sell more?
In this guide, we'll discuss -
Let's dive in.
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a blanket term that covers a myriad of technologies like machine learning, NLP, NLU & NLG, computer vision, deep learning, and more.
At their core, all of the technologies mentioned assist machines perform specific cognitive tasks as well as, or better than human involvement.
When it comes to sales, AI is not just used to sort out tons of data generated by sales teams can be leveraged by teams to make data-driven decisions with features such as sentiment analysis, enhanced customer service, automate repetitive tasks, and more.
Sales managers can now make accurate predictions, recommendations, and decisions backed by data to boost your revenue.
For profitable businesses, artificial intelligence for sales teams means a greater ability to organize mountains of eye-opening data in real-time and use it again to gain deeper insights into customer data and buying habits.
Although some important decisions can be left to an actual human salesperson, such as reading body language, navigating complex-decision making, and interpreting customers' tone of voice.
However, artificial intelligence only expedites this process giving more room for sales teams to focus on making a sale.
These functions could range from retrieving purchase history, and social media activities, to drafting emails with templates, market trends, and more.
Additionally, AI tools can also help in revenue forecasting, analyzing customer behavior, identifying leads with high purchase intent based on their interaction with the brand, and uncovering other relevant insights on customers that can help personalize their buying experience.
The role of AI in sales is to leverage data analysis algorithms to handle cognitive work that is too heavy for sales teams to actually handle on their own.
It also means less human involvement and reliance on human intervention, which can be hard to retain in traditional sales teams.
Now, this brings us to the next part - why does AI play a vital role in sales?
Sales managers are perpetually looking to optimize performance to achieve optimum results, and this is where artificial intelligence and machine learning tools come into play.
On the sales side, AI is all about accelerating the sales cycle, sales tracking, and making more room for more productive interactions.
However, contrary to what people think, artificial intelligence is not going to replace human reps. In fact, it can help sales teams quite a lot.
It gives sales reps the right insights and tools to work smarter and form better relationships with potential customers and existing customers, boosting their ability to reach their sales goals.
By handing over excessive data-driven tasks to AI tools, sales teams can have more time to develop and reap the awards for their individual selling skills.

Although sales are traditionally a people-to-people business, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are dismantling how expert sellers think to establish a fine balance between humans and machines.
Automation is already making tremendous waves in the field of sales and its influence will only continue to grow.
In addition, artificial intelligence accelerates sales processes and helps sales professionals focus on outcome-based optimization with data.
An AI-powered tool can automate daunting processes such as manual data entry, administrative tasks, lead generation, profiling, and scoring, and optimize the sales pipeline to generate more leads and bring in more revenue.
Here are eight ways AI will transform sales in the future -
While a superhuman sales team cannot be completely replaced by a machine, it can be made stronger and more capable with the help of technology.
AI has a ton of promise and the opportunities for growth seem boundless.
Artificial intelligence is being heavily adopted by forward-thinking companies because it offers great convenience to both buyers and sellers.
With its potential to streamline workflows, personalize solutions, and predict the best course of action for closing deals, AI in sales is indeed a powerful tool for increasing sales revenue and setting the stage for long-term success.
Sales leaders need to decide right now where they plan to be on the adoption curve of AI.
First adapters and close followers will more likely experience benefits while lagging companies stand to benefit from the lessons learned from not switching to AI sooner.
If you are looking to explore the possibilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning to boost your sales revenue engine, book a demo with us now.
Regardless of the model your business follows, AI for sales can transform the way your business operates. AI can increase selling hours, automate repetitive tasks, analyze customer behavior, improve productivity, and more to increase overall sales deals.

For salespeople, AI in sales helps them automate mundane tasks, sales forecasting, lead generation, data-packed reports, and more. For marketers, AI enables scalable growth, drives revenue, personalization, organization of data, and accurate prospect hunting to excel in their roles by engaging with their audience through highly relevant and targeted messaging.
AI augments sales operations but does not replace them. It reduces administrative tasks giving sellers more time to prospect, look for new revenue, and upsell existing clients.
AI for sales is useful for companies to look at AI through the lens of business capabilities as opposed to technologies.
AI can support three primary needs - Automating business processes, engaging customers and sales reps, and gaining insights through data analysis.
‍
AI and machine learning have improved efficiency and accuracy with reduced wastage of resources.
Some of the benefits include - reducing human errors, multi-tasking, augmenting capabilities, and increasing accuracy and efficiency.

In this day and age of modern selling, technology has brought together product and service information at consumers' fingertips.
Possessing basic knowledge about technology can help consumers quickly Google the lowest price of a product, and the ingredients of a product, watch YouTube videos to understand the features and their corresponding benefits and browse through customer reviews.
This raises the question - what role does the sales team actually play?
But, read a little further, and you'll discover that the role of a sales team plays a huge role! It's however, now, softer than before.
But, what are soft sales skills?
For instance, dressing appropriately for the job is considered a skill.
Despite what some people say, the ability to learn a particular set of skills can be taught. It isn't an innate ability that only specific people naturally relate with. On the contrary, there's an entire industry of high-priced consultants, books, webinars, sales gurus, influencers, and an endless stream of articles built around teaching these soft sales skills.
While the list of soft skills may be exhaustive, focusing on the right ones will help you move forward.
In this blog, we'll discuss -
Let's begin.
Soft skills in sales are a set of communication skills that must be built on an interpersonal and intrapersonal foundation that can help a salesperson empathize and connect with their potential customer.
These skills, when acquired, can also help sales reps work more efficiently and achieve their maximum potential in their sales role.
The soft selling process, in a manner, is related to soft sales skills. It involves a strategy that prioritizes the quality of relationship building with your prospects over how quickly you can make a sale.
The term "soft skills" refers to non-technical knowledge relevant to the way people work.
Sales reps can possess technical skills and know the product/service inside-out, but the inability to build a rapport with the leads could lead to deals not going through.
This is where sales teams who emphasize on soft skills that complement the hard selling skills tend to build long term relationships with the leads, and ensure long-term success.
Soft skills training includes communication skills, intrapersonal interaction, time management, listening skills, empathy, and kindness. As a result, high-performing salespeople develop these sales skills to complement their job-specific and technical abilities learned to progress further.
Often, in a sales organization, these skills are overlooked.
Self-awareness, confidence, team performance, and communication methods are all critical leadership qualities that, unfortunately, get diminished when referred to as "soft."
Incorporating soft skills training courses for sales teams is a wise decision if you want your sales metrics to skyrocket.
With this breakthrough, sales leaders can better grasp an individual sales rep's performance, areas they can improve, and how the entire sales team can learn from one another.
So, what sales skills do you need to be a successful salesperson?
Although there are several types of transferable sales skills, we will focus on three primary skill sets -
Here's a quick overview of what these skills entail -
Basic sales skills include skills every salesperson must be acclimatized with - they're fundamental and relatively simple.
Some examples of basic sales skills include a sales rep's ability to -
Although these skills may seem exceptionally simple, some sales reps overlook them. Unfortunately, you cannot succeed without them in the sales world.
Soft skills for sales reps include possessing non-technical, non-quantifiable skills that have an equal, if not greater impact than other sales skills.
Examples of soft skills include -
Relationship building with customers can go a long way and boost closing sales numbers.
In an increasingly virtual world, imbibing these skills are even more critical. With face-to-face interactions moving online, it's much easier for prospects to disengage and build rapport.
Hard skills of successful salespeople refer to the entire set of "teachable" skills, such as industry knowledge, knowing their way around sales tools, and more an employee can learn through their organization's technical training and education.
For instance, if you are selling a customer relationship management software (CRM), the set of hard skills a salesperson should include -
Although hard skills can be easily taught, they need to be practiced.
Now that you are more familiar with the different types of sales skills a salesperson should have, let's address the question,
"What specific set of sales skills should a salesperson must have?"
Here is the ten most important soft skills successful salespeople must learn -
To be a successful sales professional, it is absolutely essential to be able to put yourself in another person's shoes.
Having empathy is one of the key soft skills required to help steer talks in a positive direction.
With empathy, you can identify a potential customer's pain points, motivation, fears, desires, and more to give you a notion of when you should push forward and when you should hold back.
Above all, empathy serves in the development to build meaningful relationships with potential customers.
Even if they may not be able to recall everything you said, they will never forget how you made them feel. In the sales world, the last thing you need is for a customer to feel being taken advantage of, or as if you aren't looking out for their best interests.
Always let your customers know that you are on their side because ultimately, customer success is your success.
The easiest way to make a sale is to understand and learn everything your potential customer needs.
How can you know what they want and need without possessing listening skills?
Simple, you listen to them.
Sometimes, in a rush to close deals, you attempt to oversell your product or service because you're pressed for time. So, it's easy to slip into the habit of badgering your customers from buying your product and taking off their ears till they nod.
However, that will have a negative impact on not just your organization, but also on you, as a salesperson.
Instead, concentrate on paying your full attention to your prospects. They often tell you their pain points, struggles, and windows of opportunities openly, if you just listen to them.
Ask relevant and important questions to unravel deeper issues and direct the conversation in a way that benefits you with all the vital information you need, but avoid taking over.
Great salespeople are seldom satisfied.
They want to improve themselves to grow better mentally, professionally, and spiritually.
People with a growth mindset believe that hard work will help them achieve their full potential, whereas people with a fixed mindset believe their skills are innate and cannot be improved.
As we mentioned at the beginning of this blog, skills are not innate, as some people believe it to be.
Those with a growth mindset are often more successful and for good reasons.
Fortunately, you too can develop a growth mindset if you do not already have one -
Developing these skills will help you build a growth mindset that will serve you well in sales.
Having a sales team capable of adapting to new changes at work is extremely valuable to any organization.
But, in sales, it's critical.
With the sales world constantly evolving, sales reps are constantly trying to keep up.
If you thrive on routine and predictability, you're highly unlikely to become successful. One of the most interesting aspects of the sales world is the ability to meet all sorts of new people under unique circumstances.
It takes adaptability to roll with the changes and punches.
Additionally, buyers are way more intelligent than they were in 2001 - what worked then will almost certainly not work in 2022.
Develop adaptability by having an open mind and implementing regular feedback and recommendations to be in better shape.
"No, thanks, maybe not this time. We don't have the budget."
These words are painfully familiar for most sales reps. When rejection takes a toll on you, it alone can be sufficient to change courses for even the best sales reps and consider a career change.
The only way to keep pushing sales professionals going forward is to build their resilience.
Teaching resilience is to assist your sales teams to learn a way to bounce back from rejection. Resilient people always stay positive, do not take a "no" personally, and view failures as opportunities for growth.
To help your sales team develop resilience, pair them up with a supportive mentor who coaches them to arise into a growth mindset, manage emotions, build relationships, and other important sales soft skills to excel as a sales professional.
With this being their unswerving position, it's practically impossible to hit their sales quotas without working for 60+ hours in a week. This not only increases the chances of burnout but also quickly demotivates them.
Time is the most valuable asset. The feeling of wasted time can be incredibly disappointing, especially when money is involved and does not display any progress in the process.
To master this soft skill, as a sales organization, you must invest in the right sales tools.
Lack of time management skills is likely not a deliberate behavior of your sales team; rather, it's due to a lack of access to the right resources and a passive habit.
Leverage an intelligent sales tool such as Salesken and a CRM software to automate the most redundant tasks to free up time, so sales reps can actually focus on making a sale, rather than spending their time doing administrative tasks.
To become a top-level sales professional, it is vital to becoming a time management expert. Luckily, it's all possible to do with a myriad of sales tools available at your disposal!
The best sales professionals are exceptional communicators.
As a customer, are you likely to purchase a product from someone who struggles to communicate or someone who can effectively pitch their product?
Answer: It's the latter.
Regardless of virtual or in-person calls, both verbal and non-verbal communication are key soft skills for sales professionals to master.
When it comes to verbal communication, it is not always about what you say, it's how you say it. Clear communication is all about finding out ways that engage your client to the fullest.
Some best practices to follow are -
Asking the right questions is also a valuable way of finding answers to your questions and makes the interaction easy.
When it comes to non-verbal communication, how you conduct yourself during sales calls goes a long way to closing sales deals.
Here are some best practices to follow -
In conclusion, good non-verbal cues and verbal communication skills indicate that you are genuinely interested and engaged in the conversation, and not just their sale.
Emotional intelligence allows you to understand and appreciate how others are feeling and learn how to manage your own emotions.
People with high emotional intelligence can naturally relate to others and consider your advice if you are emotionally knowledgeable.
Emotional intelligence is categorized into four groups -
Emotional intelligence is a highly valuable soft skill to possess in both your professional and personal life. With this, you can easily determine how to proceed during a sales call, even the unpleasant ones.
One of the greatest challenges in the sales world is that of the mindset.
Where old, seasoned sellers convinced their users to buy a product, today's sales professionals should see it as a way of problem solving.
This insinuates working toward a result that is less about making the sale and more about eradicating, or minimizing the barriers between your customer and you, and providing the best solutions.
Problem solving is a long-term commitment that helps the customer perceive you as someone genuine and realizes that you place their needs above yours. That primacy will always show to customers, thus resulting in building rapport and meaningful relationships that set you up for long-term wins.
When it comes to possessing the most critical sales soft skills for sales professionals, persuasion is rather an important one.
Persuasion, as misconstrued by people, is not the "art of pushing." It is in fact, the art of influencing customers to do what's best in their own interest, which would also benefit your organization.
For instance, a portfolio manager helping a customer to find the best investment plans for their needs not only earns them a commission but, also sets them for customer success.
Learners can quickly acquire this sales soft skill with easy sales training by leveraging various mediums available such as an online course, company certification, and more.
The simplest difference between soft sell is that a hard sell is a direct, short-term sell whereas a soft sell is an indirect, long-term sell.
Although most sales leaders recommend soft selling, the truth is, that there is room for both approaches to thrive, depending on your situation.
Hard selling is a sales tactic that leverages a straightforward sales process to create quick sales.
Sales and marketing teams use it to convince potential customers to make a purchase immediately. Hard selling often includes the following strategies -
Soft selling is a type of sales tactic that uses conversational and intrapersonal strategies to build rapport and long-lasting customer relationships. It enables sales and marketing teams to learn the user journey, background, and stages of the buyer journey.
Soft selling often includes the following strategies -
While some sales teams come locked and loaded with loads of raw talent to become successful professionals, others need a little bit of hand-holding and assistance with their approach.
Sales soft skills are often the primary distinction between an average sales rep and top performers. Fortunately, as long as you inculcate a growth mindset and always looking to improve yourself and others around you, you can develop soft skills and turn yourself into a deal-closing machine.
To put it simply, sales soft skills are the key factor to becoming a sales rockstar.
Salesken helps sales professionals and sales managers to enhance their "sales readiness" with real-time coaching and learning. To be a part of this bandwagon and jump into the Salesken magic, book a demo with one of our experts today!


Soft skills also called people skills, are a mix of social selling and interpersonal skills, professional attitudes, and character traits that all jobs require. Teamwork, patience, communication, empathy, time management, and more are all just basic examples of soft skills.

In this day and age of modern selling, technology has brought together product and service information at consumers' fingertips.
Possessing basic knowledge about technology can help consumers quickly Google the lowest price of a product, and the ingredients of a product, watch YouTube videos to understand the features and their corresponding benefits and browse through customer reviews.
This raises the question - what role does the sales team actually play?
But, read a little further, and you'll discover that the role of a sales team plays a huge role! It's however, now, softer than before.
But, what are soft sales skills?
For instance, dressing appropriately for the job is considered a skill.
Despite what some people say, the ability to learn a particular set of skills can be taught. It isn't an innate ability that only specific people naturally relate with. On the contrary, there's an entire industry of high-priced consultants, books, webinars, sales gurus, influencers, and an endless stream of articles built around teaching these soft sales skills.
While the list of soft skills may be exhaustive, focusing on the right ones will help you move forward.
In this blog, we'll discuss -
Let's begin.
Soft skills in sales are a set of communication skills that must be built on an interpersonal and intrapersonal foundation that can help a salesperson empathize and connect with their potential customer.
These skills, when acquired, can also help sales reps work more efficiently and achieve their maximum potential in their sales role.
The soft selling process, in a manner, is related to soft sales skills. It involves a strategy that prioritizes the quality of relationship building with your prospects over how quickly you can make a sale.
The term "soft skills" refers to non-technical knowledge relevant to the way people work.
Sales reps can possess technical skills and know the product/service inside-out, but the inability to build a rapport with the leads could lead to deals not going through.
This is where sales teams who emphasize on soft skills that complement the hard selling skills tend to build long term relationships with the leads, and ensure long-term success.
Soft skills training includes communication skills, intrapersonal interaction, time management, listening skills, empathy, and kindness. As a result, high-performing salespeople develop these sales skills to complement their job-specific and technical abilities learned to progress further.
Often, in a sales organization, these skills are overlooked.
Self-awareness, confidence, team performance, and communication methods are all critical leadership qualities that, unfortunately, get diminished when referred to as "soft."
Incorporating soft skills training courses for sales teams is a wise decision if you want your sales metrics to skyrocket.
With this breakthrough, sales leaders can better grasp an individual sales rep's performance, areas they can improve, and how the entire sales team can learn from one another.
So, what sales skills do you need to be a successful salesperson?
Although there are several types of transferable sales skills, we will focus on three primary skill sets -
Here's a quick overview of what these skills entail -
Basic sales skills include skills every salesperson must be acclimatized with - they're fundamental and relatively simple.
Some examples of basic sales skills include a sales rep's ability to -
Although these skills may seem exceptionally simple, some sales reps overlook them. Unfortunately, you cannot succeed without them in the sales world.
Soft skills for sales reps include possessing non-technical, non-quantifiable skills that have an equal, if not greater impact than other sales skills.
Examples of soft skills include -
Relationship building with customers can go a long way and boost closing sales numbers.
In an increasingly virtual world, imbibing these skills are even more critical. With face-to-face interactions moving online, it's much easier for prospects to disengage and build rapport.
Hard skills of successful salespeople refer to the entire set of "teachable" skills, such as industry knowledge, knowing their way around sales tools, and more an employee can learn through their organization's technical training and education.
For instance, if you are selling a customer relationship management software (CRM), the set of hard skills a salesperson should include -
Although hard skills can be easily taught, they need to be practiced.
Now that you are more familiar with the different types of sales skills a salesperson should have, let's address the question,
"What specific set of sales skills should a salesperson must have?"
Here is the ten most important soft skills successful salespeople must learn -
To be a successful sales professional, it is absolutely essential to be able to put yourself in another person's shoes.
Having empathy is one of the key soft skills required to help steer talks in a positive direction.
With empathy, you can identify a potential customer's pain points, motivation, fears, desires, and more to give you a notion of when you should push forward and when you should hold back.
Above all, empathy serves in the development to build meaningful relationships with potential customers.
Even if they may not be able to recall everything you said, they will never forget how you made them feel. In the sales world, the last thing you need is for a customer to feel being taken advantage of, or as if you aren't looking out for their best interests.
Always let your customers know that you are on their side because ultimately, customer success is your success.
The easiest way to make a sale is to understand and learn everything your potential customer needs.
How can you know what they want and need without possessing listening skills?
Simple, you listen to them.
Sometimes, in a rush to close deals, you attempt to oversell your product or service because you're pressed for time. So, it's easy to slip into the habit of badgering your customers from buying your product and taking off their ears till they nod.
However, that will have a negative impact on not just your organization, but also on you, as a salesperson.
Instead, concentrate on paying your full attention to your prospects. They often tell you their pain points, struggles, and windows of opportunities openly, if you just listen to them.
Ask relevant and important questions to unravel deeper issues and direct the conversation in a way that benefits you with all the vital information you need, but avoid taking over.
Great salespeople are seldom satisfied.
They want to improve themselves to grow better mentally, professionally, and spiritually.
People with a growth mindset believe that hard work will help them achieve their full potential, whereas people with a fixed mindset believe their skills are innate and cannot be improved.
As we mentioned at the beginning of this blog, skills are not innate, as some people believe it to be.
Those with a growth mindset are often more successful and for good reasons.
Fortunately, you too can develop a growth mindset if you do not already have one -
Developing these skills will help you build a growth mindset that will serve you well in sales.
Having a sales team capable of adapting to new changes at work is extremely valuable to any organization.
But, in sales, it's critical.
With the sales world constantly evolving, sales reps are constantly trying to keep up.
If you thrive on routine and predictability, you're highly unlikely to become successful. One of the most interesting aspects of the sales world is the ability to meet all sorts of new people under unique circumstances.
It takes adaptability to roll with the changes and punches.
Additionally, buyers are way more intelligent than they were in 2001 - what worked then will almost certainly not work in 2022.
Develop adaptability by having an open mind and implementing regular feedback and recommendations to be in better shape.
"No, thanks, maybe not this time. We don't have the budget."
These words are painfully familiar for most sales reps. When rejection takes a toll on you, it alone can be sufficient to change courses for even the best sales reps and consider a career change.
The only way to keep pushing sales professionals going forward is to build their resilience.
Teaching resilience is to assist your sales teams to learn a way to bounce back from rejection. Resilient people always stay positive, do not take a "no" personally, and view failures as opportunities for growth.
To help your sales team develop resilience, pair them up with a supportive mentor who coaches them to arise into a growth mindset, manage emotions, build relationships, and other important sales soft skills to excel as a sales professional.
With this being their unswerving position, it's practically impossible to hit their sales quotas without working for 60+ hours in a week. This not only increases the chances of burnout but also quickly demotivates them.
Time is the most valuable asset. The feeling of wasted time can be incredibly disappointing, especially when money is involved and does not display any progress in the process.
To master this soft skill, as a sales organization, you must invest in the right sales tools.
Lack of time management skills is likely not a deliberate behavior of your sales team; rather, it's due to a lack of access to the right resources and a passive habit.
Leverage an intelligent sales tool such as Salesken and a CRM software to automate the most redundant tasks to free up time, so sales reps can actually focus on making a sale, rather than spending their time doing administrative tasks.
To become a top-level sales professional, it is vital to becoming a time management expert. Luckily, it's all possible to do with a myriad of sales tools available at your disposal!
The best sales professionals are exceptional communicators.
As a customer, are you likely to purchase a product from someone who struggles to communicate or someone who can effectively pitch their product?
Answer: It's the latter.
Regardless of virtual or in-person calls, both verbal and non-verbal communication are key soft skills for sales professionals to master.
When it comes to verbal communication, it is not always about what you say, it's how you say it. Clear communication is all about finding out ways that engage your client to the fullest.
Some best practices to follow are -
Asking the right questions is also a valuable way of finding answers to your questions and makes the interaction easy.
When it comes to non-verbal communication, how you conduct yourself during sales calls goes a long way to closing sales deals.
Here are some best practices to follow -
In conclusion, good non-verbal cues and verbal communication skills indicate that you are genuinely interested and engaged in the conversation, and not just their sale.
Emotional intelligence allows you to understand and appreciate how others are feeling and learn how to manage your own emotions.
People with high emotional intelligence can naturally relate to others and consider your advice if you are emotionally knowledgeable.
Emotional intelligence is categorized into four groups -
Emotional intelligence is a highly valuable soft skill to possess in both your professional and personal life. With this, you can easily determine how to proceed during a sales call, even the unpleasant ones.
One of the greatest challenges in the sales world is that of the mindset.
Where old, seasoned sellers convinced their users to buy a product, today's sales professionals should see it as a way of problem solving.
This insinuates working toward a result that is less about making the sale and more about eradicating, or minimizing the barriers between your customer and you, and providing the best solutions.
Problem solving is a long-term commitment that helps the customer perceive you as someone genuine and realizes that you place their needs above yours. That primacy will always show to customers, thus resulting in building rapport and meaningful relationships that set you up for long-term wins.
When it comes to possessing the most critical sales soft skills for sales professionals, persuasion is rather an important one.
Persuasion, as misconstrued by people, is not the "art of pushing." It is in fact, the art of influencing customers to do what's best in their own interest, which would also benefit your organization.
For instance, a portfolio manager helping a customer to find the best investment plans for their needs not only earns them a commission but, also sets them for customer success.
Learners can quickly acquire this sales soft skill with easy sales training by leveraging various mediums available such as an online course, company certification, and more.
The simplest difference between soft sell is that a hard sell is a direct, short-term sell whereas a soft sell is an indirect, long-term sell.
Although most sales leaders recommend soft selling, the truth is, that there is room for both approaches to thrive, depending on your situation.
Hard selling is a sales tactic that leverages a straightforward sales process to create quick sales.
Sales and marketing teams use it to convince potential customers to make a purchase immediately. Hard selling often includes the following strategies -
Soft selling is a type of sales tactic that uses conversational and intrapersonal strategies to build rapport and long-lasting customer relationships. It enables sales and marketing teams to learn the user journey, background, and stages of the buyer journey.
Soft selling often includes the following strategies -
While some sales teams come locked and loaded with loads of raw talent to become successful professionals, others need a little bit of hand-holding and assistance with their approach.
Sales soft skills are often the primary distinction between an average sales rep and top performers. Fortunately, as long as you inculcate a growth mindset and always looking to improve yourself and others around you, you can develop soft skills and turn yourself into a deal-closing machine.
To put it simply, sales soft skills are the key factor to becoming a sales rockstar.
Salesken helps sales professionals and sales managers to enhance their "sales readiness" with real-time coaching and learning. To be a part of this bandwagon and jump into the Salesken magic, book a demo with one of our experts today!


Soft skills also called people skills, are a mix of social selling and interpersonal skills, professional attitudes, and character traits that all jobs require. Teamwork, patience, communication, empathy, time management, and more are all just basic examples of soft skills.

Developing a sales strategy is the need of the hour for Business-to-Business organizations. A sales strategy helps businesses to develop clarity over their target markets and helps in driving remarkable results.
Sales teams often struggle to develop a personalized sales strategy that can generate, nurture and convert leads successfully. In fact, there is no one-size-fits-all framework when it comes to developing a sales strategy. An ideal B2B selling strategy is business-specific.
However, there are some approaches and tips that can help organizations to develop impactful sales tactics and strategies. This guide will list some of those approaches for achieving long-term results.
A B2B sales strategy is the mix of different sales tactics and methods to convert leads into customers. Some of the critical aspects of a sales strategy include identifying your target customers, developing lead nurturing strategies to interact with these prospects, and developing a suitable sales process.
Some of the critical elements of a sales strategy include:
We are sharing 8 tried and tested sales strategies to help the sales teams and startup founders in growing their brand presence. Start putting these strategies into action to derive results:
Many B2B startups create a cold outreach strategy where they reach out to different businesses with the generated leads. Cold emails might have a response rate of up to 40%, but it only happens when the sales reps understand their target markets and develop a personalized cold email strategy.
Therefore, reaching out to a niche-specific market is very important to execute successful B2B outreach campaigns. At the beginning of your outreach program, you can create a target customer profile based on common pain points and purchasing power. Accordingly, sales reps should reach out to these prospects for further interactions.
Consider Slack as an example. When this instant messaging platform started, the industry was already filled with strong players like Microsoft Office 365, Adobe Acrobat, Google Workspace, etc. However, Slack identified a clear gap in terms of remote team collaboration and targeted brands that are struggling on that front. Slack has been experiencing strong growth ever since and the brand currently has a 10 million+ active user base.
Wondering where to start? A sales team should start by finding the answers to these questions:
Once you find the answers to these questions, it will be easier to plan your sales strategies.
A business might generate countless leads. However, all of these leads are not bearing the same value. A great sales strategy is to use the lead scoring method to identify which lead is valuable for the business.
Marketing and sales teams use various lead scoring frameworks to identify the worthiness of a lead. You can score a lead based on different characteristics like:
And the list goes on. Sales managers can score these leads on a scale of 1 to 100 based on their relevance.
By including lead scoring within the sales strategy, businesses can restrict the nurturing activities of unqualified leads. This can help the sales reps to prioritize the valuable leads and they can free up their time spent chasing each lead coming their way.
As shown in the above image, B2B sales teams can set their criteria when it comes to lead scoring. Some of the criteria to analyze potential customers’ intent can be:
The prospect who scores higher based on these criteria can be considered as the ideal lead.
Every sales rep must improve their active listening skills to understand prospects’ expectations, objections, feature requests, and other factors. In fact, sales teams should record prospect calls, note down these factors, and include these within their sales pitch to increase the conversion rate.
Since sales reps interact with multiple prospects each day, it can be a challenge for them to summarize the key takeaways from each conversation. Here are a few steps to improve active listening for sales reps:
Sales teams can maintain common Trello boards where they share their notes, learnings, and key takeaways from these prospect calls and collaborate seamlessly with each other to form the sales strategies.
When we say outbound lead generation is tricky, hopefully, most departments will agree. Hence, it is a smart choice to look for an alternative method of lead generation.
A great way to generate new leads is through referrals. A referral program is all about identifying your loyal customers who will happily recommend you to their peers. The sales team can then send a follow-up mail to these prospects to identify whether they are a good fit to move forward.
Here is an outreach template that you can use to ask for referrals:
Hi [First name], Hope you are doing well! Brand X is our customer and we have helped them achieve [ some results] within [timeline]. We believe the CMO of Brand X, [Name] has referred our services to you. We came to know you are facing [ a problem the prospect is facing] and we believe our product [name of product] can resolve this. Want to discuss this sometime next week? Let me know your availability. Thanks, [Your name]
Sometimes prospects are uncertain about your products and services. Sales reps should address these uncertainties at the first attempt.
If a prospect is quiet during the product demo or is not asking as many questions as you hoped for, they are probably confused about certain features of the product. Sales reps should immediately ask them the reason behind their confusion instead of proceeding with their sales pitch.
You can directly ask them if they would like a more specific explanation anywhere. It is your responsibility to start a conversation and help the prospects clear their doubts before moving further.
Sales strategies have evolved over the years. B2B professionals no longer expect transactional communication with sales reps. Instead, they expect the reps to build a rapport with the B2B decision-makers, add value and help them make purchase decisions eventually.
However, when you are targeting a B2B company, be prepared to interact with multiple stakeholders. Generally, the following group of stakeholders plays a key role:
The sales reps often have to go through the gatekeeper and other groups of stakeholders before interacting with the decision-maker. To keep your sales cycle shorter, it should be your top priority to connect with the decision-maker quickly.
Here is an email template to reach out to the gatekeeper:
Hi [First name], Quick question: Who is heading the [Name of relevant department] in your company? They will surely be interested to know how [your company name] helped [competitor’s name] to achieve [results] with our [product/solution name]. If you are the right person to discuss this further, let’s connect sometime next week to explore this. Best, [Sales rep’s name]
Before developing new sales strategies, make sure to document your current strategies and processes in a sales playbook format.
The best way to map and streamline your current sales process is by interacting with each sales rep. Here are some questions that you can ask the reps to gain more transparency in your sales process:
Once you find the answers to these questions and map them successfully, it will be easier for you to identify the gaps. Therefore, you can develop new sales strategies to address these gaps and accelerate your sales system.
Unrealistic benchmarks can lead to a lack of motivation for the business development executives. Identifying the appropriate set of sales metrics can help the sales managers to set suitable benchmarks for the sales teams.
The steps to set benchmarks are as follows:
Sales teams might come across various metrics for different categories of the sales department. Here are the most common metrics to consider:
Make sure to assign these metrics to the right sales reps for better results.
Once all the metrics are collected, the next step is to calculate the benchmarks. Two common ways to approach this are:
The second method can be complex and time-consuming. However, it is more personalized and can deliver more realistic results.
Finally, when the benchmarks are defined, the sales managers can start communicating them with the sales teams. They can either communicate these benchmarks over team meetings or interact with the reps on a one-to-one basis.
Communicating these benchmarks will help the sales reps to stay on the same page with the larger organization and ensure that they plan their sales strategies accordingly.
Developing a sales strategy is only the first step. Businesses should focus on implementing these sales strategies in the smartest possible way to derive results.

Many B2B startups create a cold outreach strategy where they reach out to different businesses with the generated leads. Cold emails might have a response rate of up to 40%, but it only happens when the sales reps understand their target markets and develop a personalized cold email strategy.
Therefore, reaching out to a niche-specific market is very important to execute successful B2B outreach campaigns. At the beginning of your outreach program, you can create a target customer profile based on common pain points and purchasing power. Accordingly, sales reps should reach out to these prospects for further interactions.
Consider Slack as an example. When this instant messaging platform started, the industry was already filled with strong players like Microsoft Office 365, Adobe Acrobat, Google Workspace, etc. However, Slack identified a clear gap in terms of remote team collaboration and targeted brands that are struggling on that front. Slack has been experiencing strong growth ever since and the brand currently has a 10 million+ active user base.
Wondering where to start? A sales team should start by finding the answers to these questions:
Once you find the answers to these questions, it will be easier to plan your sales strategies.
A business might generate countless leads. However, all of these leads are not bearing the same value. A great sales strategy is to use the lead scoring method to identify which lead is valuable for the business.
Marketing and sales teams use various lead scoring frameworks to identify the worthiness of a lead. You can score a lead based on different characteristics like:
And the list goes on. Sales managers can score these leads on a scale of 1 to 100 based on their relevance.
By including lead scoring within the sales strategy, businesses can restrict the nurturing activities of unqualified leads. This can help the sales reps to prioritize the valuable leads and they can free up their time spent chasing each lead coming their way.
As shown in the above image, B2B sales teams can set their criteria when it comes to lead scoring. Some of the criteria to analyze potential customers’ intent can be:
The prospect who scores higher based on these criteria can be considered as the ideal lead.
Every sales rep must improve their active listening skills to understand prospects’ expectations, objections, feature requests, and other factors. In fact, sales teams should record prospect calls, note down these factors, and include these within their sales pitch to increase the conversion rate.
Since sales reps interact with multiple prospects each day, it can be a challenge for them to summarize the key takeaways from each conversation. Here are a few steps to improve active listening for sales reps:
Sales teams can maintain common Trello boards where they share their notes, learnings, and key takeaways from these prospect calls and collaborate seamlessly with each other to form the sales strategies.
When we say outbound lead generation is tricky, hopefully, most departments will agree. Hence, it is a smart choice to look for an alternative method of lead generation.
A great way to generate new leads is through referrals. A referral program is all about identifying your loyal customers who will happily recommend you to their peers. The sales team can then send a follow-up mail to these prospects to identify whether they are a good fit to move forward.
Here is an outreach template that you can use to ask for referrals:
Hi [First name], Hope you are doing well! Brand X is our customer and we have helped them achieve [ some results] within [timeline]. We believe the CMO of Brand X, [Name] has referred our services to you. We came to know you are facing [ a problem the prospect is facing] and we believe our product [name of product] can resolve this. Want to discuss this sometime next week? Let me know your availability. Thanks, [Your name]
Sometimes prospects are uncertain about your products and services. Sales reps should address these uncertainties at the first attempt.
If a prospect is quiet during the product demo or is not asking as many questions as you hoped for, they are probably confused about certain features of the product. Sales reps should immediately ask them the reason behind their confusion instead of proceeding with their sales pitch.
You can directly ask them if they would like a more specific explanation anywhere. It is your responsibility to start a conversation and help the prospects clear their doubts before moving further.
Sales strategies have evolved over the years. B2B professionals no longer expect transactional communication with sales reps. Instead, they expect the reps to build a rapport with the B2B decision-makers, add value and help them make purchase decisions eventually.
However, when you are targeting a B2B company, be prepared to interact with multiple stakeholders. Generally, the following group of stakeholders plays a key role:
The sales reps often have to go through the gatekeeper and other groups of stakeholders before interacting with the decision-maker. To keep your sales cycle shorter, it should be your top priority to connect with the decision-maker quickly.
Here is an email template to reach out to the gatekeeper:
Hi [First name], Quick question: Who is heading the [Name of relevant department] in your company? They will surely be interested to know how [your company name] helped [competitor’s name] to achieve [results] with our [product/solution name]. If you are the right person to discuss this further, let’s connect sometime next week to explore this. Best, [Sales rep’s name]
Before developing new sales strategies, make sure to document your current strategies and processes in a sales playbook format.
The best way to map and streamline your current sales process is by interacting with each sales rep. Here are some questions that you can ask the reps to gain more transparency in your sales process:
Once you find the answers to these questions and map them successfully, it will be easier for you to identify the gaps. Therefore, you can develop new sales strategies to address these gaps and accelerate your sales system.
Unrealistic benchmarks can lead to a lack of motivation for the business development executives. Identifying the appropriate set of sales metrics can help the sales managers to set suitable benchmarks for the sales teams.
The steps to set benchmarks are as follows:
Sales teams might come across various metrics for different categories of the sales department. Here are the most common metrics to consider:
Make sure to assign these metrics to the right sales reps for better results.
Once all the metrics are collected, the next step is to calculate the benchmarks. Two common ways to approach this are:
The second method can be complex and time-consuming. However, it is more personalized and can deliver more realistic results.
Finally, when the benchmarks are defined, the sales managers can start communicating them with the sales teams. They can either communicate these benchmarks over team meetings or interact with the reps on a one-to-one basis.
Communicating these benchmarks will help the sales reps to stay on the same page with the larger organization and ensure that they plan their sales strategies accordingly.
Developing a sales strategy is only the first step. Businesses should focus on implementing these sales strategies in the smartest possible way to derive results.

Business-to-business sales (B2B sales) describes transactions between two businesses– it occurs when a business sells its products or services to another business rather than to individual customers. B2B sales typically involves a longer sales cycle, multiple touchpoints, and greater complexity. Keeping up with these challenges requires a clear and concise B2B sales strategy.
There are various B2B sales strategy models that businesses can adopt. However, the one that stands out is the Discovery Model by Steve Anderson and Dave Stein. This model focuses on an in-depth understanding of the target buyer's persona by collecting information on the following:
These discovery questions will help you understand your customer and their pain points well, so you can initiate very specific conversations in ways that your competitors can’t due to their insufficient knowledge.
In our blog post How To Be A Successful B2B Sales Representative: A B2B Sales Rep Success Guide, we focused on the B2B sales process, and the traits a successful B2B sales rep should cultivate. In this post, we cover the best tips for building your B2B sales strategy and boosting your conversion.
Here are seven fundamental tips to help you get started with the B2B sales strategy:
A successful B2B sales strategy is customer-centric. It begins with listening to the customers, understanding their pain points thoroughly, and only then taking targeted, customised action. Train your sales reps in active listening and make sure that they encourage the prospects to speak. This will make the prospects feel valued, help build genuine rapport and help the sales reps understand the prospects’ requirements.
Your B2B sales strategy should be results-focused. Your product may be feature-rich, but the prospects are not always looking for those features. All they care about is how your product can solve their unique set of problems. Hence, be results-oriented and focus on the outcomes you can provide the customers to build their interest.
Price is important but not the only factor that matters. Focus on relationship-building first, as the price can wait. If you can impress a prospect with your products, B2B professionals may be flexible with the price. So, focus on fulfilling the prospects’ goals first, add value, and know that you can always negotiate on price later.
Are your sales reps using the same product deck for all prospects? That’s a red flag for sure!
No two prospects’ requirements and needs will be the same, and the onus is on your sales team to customise the pitch accordingly. B2B sales reps should personalise the decks based on the prospect’s pain points. This will help the deal move forward.
Your sales team should do more than simply “selling”. They need to research, communicate with customers, focus on relationship building, and craft the perfect sales pitch that is irresistible to potential customers. B2B sales reps are responsible for not just selling but for the entire lifecycle - from research to building lasting relationships.
Research is the key first step in B2B sales, and research skills are essential for B2B sales reps. Sales reps should be ready with a streamlined research process, even before conducting the discovery call, because otherwise it’s throwing stones in the dark and wasting precious time and resources. Through research, they will understand their target business, its positioning, pain points and key decision-makers. This ensures that they are pitching to the right audience and improves their chances of success.
In B2B sales, it is very important to differentiate your offerings. So, analyse your competitors’ sales strategy, learn how they are positioning their products and services, and finally, project your brand so that the differentiating factor between your brand and the competitor’s brand is crystal clear, as are the advantages of choosing you.
B2B sales strategies should be conversion-focused. A successful B2B sales strategy will ensure lead conversion through seamless relationship-building. Here are five foolproof strategies to get started:
Sales managers should keep an eye on the sales team's overall performance but empower their sales reps to make decisions as much as possible. Sales reps already need to make crucial decisions around the target audience, problem-solving and lead generation. Each rep having the freedom and independence to make some decisions on their own will speed up the process, reduce friction and help them stay accountable and ensure a solid grasp of the prospects’ needs.
Moreover, each sales rep has their skills and way of operating. For example, someone may be good at written communication, while another may be good at persuasion. Empowering the reps will ensure that they can capitalise on their individual competencies and close more sales deals smoothly.
Nobody can stop your growth when your sales and marketing strategies are aligned. In the B2B scenario, sales and marketing teams play complementary roles. For example, marketing teams are responsible for creating content to attract prospects organically, while sales teams are responsible for acquiring and retaining more customers to grow business success.
A tried and tested way to improve collaboration between sales and marketing teams is to align goals but also clearly define roles. For instance, your marketing team’s goal can be generating new leads, while the sales team’s goal can be to convert the same leads. Clear roles, common goals, transparent communication, and consistent exchange of knowledge can help these teams coordinate efficiently.
Before you start with your sales efforts, create the ideal buyer persona. A buyer persona is a profile of the targeted buyers that include the customer’s demographics, professional description, needs and so on. The more detailed your buyer persona is, the easier it will be for sales reps to reach out to new prospects.
Here are a few easy steps to build your buyer persona:
Social selling is all about building your brand on social media through creating awareness and nurturing relationships with your potential customers. Contrary to popular belief, social selling is not all about launching ads, initiating discussions in DMs and promoting your products. B2B social selling focuses on building relationships with prospects and building a strong social community.
The popularity of social selling is slowly reaching its peak. 31% of B2B sales professionals have said that social selling has helped them build deeper client relationships. Hence, if you are still having second thoughts about social selling, you might want to reconsider.
Here are a few ways to make the most of social selling as your B2B sales strategy:
Sales enablement is a detailed, strategic framework for sales teams to develop an effective B2B sales process that includes better resource allocation and improved lead conversion. Sales enablement is a modern-day approach to empowering your sales reps.
Here are a few golden rules of B2B sales enablement:
Your customer needs evolve based on ever-changing marketing trends. Brands are always looking for ways to find new sales opportunities to accelerate their lead generation process. To develop a strong edge over your competitors and stand out in this landscape, you will need a stellar B2B sales strategy. B2B sales strategies help sales reps to develop in-depth knowledge about customers and their needs. As a result, it simplifies the lead generation process and lets you close more sales deals.

Sarah is a senior sales executive for a popular marketing automation tool. She’s on a call with Mike, who heads marketing for a software company called Up Tech.
UpTech has seen success over the last 5 years within the US and want to launch their business in Europe.
But they are unhappy with their current marketing automation tool and are in the market for an alternative.
Let’s join in on the call as Sarah tries to understand the needs of Up Tech.
Sarah: I did some research about your plans to go to Europe. How many office locations are you looking to add in Europe?
Mike: We will soon have 4 new offices operational in Berlin, Paris, London, and Brussels.
Sarah: That’s fantastic! Have you started hiring your sales and marketing teams?
Mike: Yes, of course!
Sarah: And will your marketing automation tool support this expansion?
Mike: No, I don’t think so
Sarah: I see. That’s unfortunate. Our tool has sales and marketing automation features combined, so you won’t need to pay for them separately. Our free plan limits are also generous, and we are constantly adding features.
Mike: Okay. Could you email me all the necessary information? Allow me a week to consult with the rest of my team.
Sarah: Alright! I will send you an email with quotations and our sales documents ASAP.
So, how did Sarah do? Mike is clearly interested since he asked for more information. Right?
Actually, There are a lot of things Sarah could have done better. Let’s look at some of the common mistakes made in this sales discovery call
The question about European expansion was not required. The locations of UpTech’s new offices will have no significance to Sarah’s product. And she’s wasted precious air time with Mike to learn more about their marketing strategy. Here’s a better version of that question.
Sarah: I did some research about your plans to go to Europe expansion. Tell me a bit more about how that would impact your marketing and operations.
This is a more open ended question and gives Sarah an opportunity to let Mike speak about his business and its relevance to her.
Sarah asked a series of yes/no (closed-ended) questions When a seller asks multiple such questions, the call becomes an interrogation, the customer shuts off instead of opening up. Without asking the right questions, Sarah will never know enough about UpTech to know if her product can solve their problems
Sarah: And will your marketing automation tool support this expansion?
Is also a closed-ended question. And all she got in response was a no. This could have been asked in a better way
Sarah: What has been your experience with your current marketing automation tool.
Mike: We want to improve automation efficiency because our marketing process is brutally slow. We also must pay for many sales automation features in our tool that many other tools offer in their free or least expensive paid lower price plans.
Asking open questions, which help you understand the customer’s current pain points helps you learn more about what matters to them.
Sarah was also not listening actively. When Mike talked about how he didn’t have confidence in his marketing automation tool supporting the European expansion, she didn’t pause to ask him “why”. And instead launched into her sales pitch
With the right questions, the seller can drill down and find a core need of the prospect that she can use to pitch her product throughout the sales cycle.
Sarah: Why do you think your tool wouldn’t support your plans in Europe?
Mike: They don’t provide support in several languages like German and French, which will make it hard for our regional teams. Adding new licenses is expensive, so we will end up having to spend a lot more than we have budgeted for. And they have not updated their product to cover many GDPR related compliance issues.
By simple listening and asking the right question - Sarah could have learnt so much about UpTech and made her sales a slam-dunk.
If the seller is impatient (or a bad listener), the quality of the need discovery call will degrade. A botched need discovery process could potentially have long-term effects on the later stages of the sales cycle.
Truly great need discovery calls can

Sarah is a senior sales executive for a popular marketing automation tool. She’s on a call with Mike, who heads marketing for a software company called Up Tech.
UpTech has seen success over the last 5 years within the US and want to launch their business in Europe.
But they are unhappy with their current marketing automation tool and are in the market for an alternative.
Let’s join in on the call as Sarah tries to understand the needs of Up Tech.

All business-to-business organizations that have excelled in their sales performance have one thing in common - a comprehensive B2B sales playbook. A sales playbook is the collection of all secret sauces that the sales team uses to convert a lead.
B2B sales playbooks typically include sales processes, methodologies, sales objectives, tried and tested sales pitch templates, etc. 42% of sales reps feel that they don’t have sufficient information before making a sales call. An insightful B2B sales playbook can fill this gap. It helps the B2B sales reps engage with prospects at each phase of the sales cycle and confidently close more deals.
Here is a detailed guide for creating a full-scale B2B sales playbook.
B2B sales is a complicated process with multiple stakeholders. Hence, the “one-size-fits-all” mindset doesn’t work in this sales process. In fact,76% f B2B buyers expect personalized attention from the vendors. That is exactly why sales teams require a B2B sales playbook.
A B2B sales playbook complies with various sales guidelines and processes that help the sales teams to attract high-quality leads, engage prospects, address their objections, negotiate better, and close more deals. Ideally, a sales playbook includes the target buyer persona, tried and tested sales processes, and the main KPIs for the sales team.
A sales playbook works as a roadmap for B2B sales professionals. If implemented right, it introduces higher efficiency to the sales team. In fact, it allows the sales managers to track the sales teams’ performance and identify the blockers in their current sales process.
Creating a sales playbook is time-consuming. In fact, most sales teams may not prioritize it as long as they keep generating leads.
However, the real-life scenarios say otherwise. According to Salesforce, organizations with a well-documented sales playbook perform 33% better. Hence, as tedious as it may sound, creating a B2B sales playbook is worth it.
Here are a few benefits of creating a B2B sales playbook:
Onboarding new sales professionals and training them with the sales technique is a must! Then again, this training process can take up weeks and even months. On the contrary, organizations can’t risk skipping this sales training as it can force the reps to follow senior reps’ selling techniques aimlessly. As a result, your brand will lack personalization.
In fact, following the same old strategies can increase the chances of repeating the mistakes. A B2B sales playbook documents enough information about the target customer profile, what works, and what doesn’t for the sales teams. As soon as a new sales rep is onboarded, sales managers can hand over the sales playbook to the rep to gain detailed insights into the organization’s sales process.
This will help them become well-versed with the sales techniques quickly and add distinctiveness to their selling process.
If a B2B sales team has already crafted some effective selling tactics, what’s the point in experimenting again and again? Sales managers should instead prioritize scattering these strategies across the team so that all reps can implement those.
A sales playbook documents all these strategies together and highlights which strategies can work for the reps in which scenario. Hence, closing high-value sales deals has become easier than ever for sales professionals.
Sales and marketing teams should follow an aligned business strategy to achieve growth. However, most organizations have a hard time achieving this because they don’t have a well-documented sales process.
A B2B sales playbook can resolve this issue by clearly defining the sales objectives, which the marketing team can well understand. As a result, both teams can collaborate seamlessly without hindering the other team’s activities.
According to HubSpot, sales reps spend only one-third of their time selling. Sales managers should provide them with all possible resources to make the most of this time. Instead of biting around the bush, sales reps should focus on identifying stellar strategies to stand out in the competition.
A sales playbook contains unlimited resources and tips that simplify reps' jobs. From highly convertible sales pitch templates to discovery questions, it has everything a rep might need for their day-to-day sales activities. Hence, a B2B sales playbook can save sales reps time and help them focus more on selling.
The structure of a B2B sales playbook can vary from organization to organization. However, some common sections should be part of any B2B sales playbook:
A B2B sales playbook must contain all company information. Some of the essential organizational information to focus on are:
A good sales playbook must provide extensive information about products and pricing. Sales professionals are responsible for communicating pricing information with potential customers. Hence, this information is a must to simplify this communication for them.
Some of the pointers to include in this section are as follows:
This is the essential aspect of creating a B2B sales playbook.
In the sales process section, you must include all the tactics and technologies to follow throughout the B2B sales cycle. For example, if the first stage of the B2B sales cycle is lead generation, the sales playbook should discuss the tried and tested ways to generate leads for the organization. This could mean cold calling, cold emailing, cold social media outreach, etc.
Sales methodology on the other hand, sales methodology is the way to approach the prospects. Sales teams should include the sales best practices in this section to help the new reps. Some of the common factors to include in this section are:
Cover sales methodologies and processes as broadly as possible so that there are is no room for doubt.
Sales reps should have in-depth information about who they are selling to. Some of the information about potential customers that should be part of your B2B sales playbook are as follows:
This information will help the sales reps to understand the prospects inside-out. Hence, they can interact with the prospects confidently during sales calls and answer their questions thoroughly.
This section mentions the KPIs that your sales team should focus on. These could be deal size, lead conversion to generation ratio, time to close a deal etc. Once the reps know about the target KPIs, it will be easier for them to understand the expectations of the sales process.
Here are the main steps to follow for creating the ideal B2B sales playbook for your organization:
USP or Unique Selling Point is what differentiates your brand from the competitors. The sooner your target buyers are aware of the USP, the easier will be the decision-making process for them. So, the first and foremost step to creating a sales playbook is to find out the USP of your brand.
Some of the best ways to identify your USP quickly are as follows:
The next critical part of a sales playbook is to include the target buyer profile. A buyer profile or user persona must include as much detail about the target buyers as possible. For example, include industry type, company size, key decision-makers, location, pain points, etc.
Wondering where to get all this information? The key is to conduct in-depth user research. Here are a few research tips for creating a detailed buyer persona:
Preparing the ideal sales playbook requires both time and effort. Make sure to assign the right tasks to the right owners. Here are some of the key people who can play major roles in creating your sales playbook:
B2B sales representatives need to participate in various outbound activities like cold calling, cold emailing, social media outreach and so on. A playbook should include scripts for these outbound activities. Senior sales professionals can help in creating convertible scripts for new sales reps. In fact, a smart way to approach this is through creating a reusable template that reps can customize as per requirements.
An “ultimate” sales playbook doesn’t exist. Sales trends are changing, and accordingly, the sales playbook must also change. Hence, updating the sales playbook regularly is a good practice. As your business grows, there will be new opportunities to explore, new prospects to meet and new objections to handle. Sales teams should continue to update these factors in the sales playbook to make it a valuable resource.
Finding it hard to create a B2B sales playbook? How about using an advanced, feature-rich, SaaS solution to automate your sales playbook?
Yes, it is possible with Salesken.

However, the real-life scenarios say otherwise. According to Salesforce, organizations with a well-documented sales playbook perform 33% better. Hence, as tedious as it may sound, creating a B2B sales playbook is worth it.
Here are a few benefits of creating a B2B sales playbook:
Onboarding new sales professionals and training them with the sales technique is a must! Then again, this training process can take up weeks and even months. On the contrary, organizations can’t risk skipping this sales training as it can force the reps to follow senior reps’ selling techniques aimlessly. As a result, your brand will lack personalization.
In fact, following the same old strategies can increase the chances of repeating the mistakes. A B2B sales playbook documents enough information about the target customer profile, what works, and what doesn’t for the sales teams. As soon as a new sales rep is onboarded, sales managers can hand over the sales playbook to the rep to gain detailed insights into the organization’s sales process.
This will help them become well-versed with the sales techniques quickly and add distinctiveness to their selling process.
If a B2B sales team has already crafted some effective selling tactics, what’s the point in experimenting again and again? Sales managers should instead prioritize scattering these strategies across the team so that all reps can implement those.
A sales playbook documents all these strategies together and highlights which strategies can work for the reps in which scenario. Hence, closing high-value sales deals has become easier than ever for sales professionals.
Sales and marketing teams should follow an aligned business strategy to achieve growth. However, most organizations have a hard time achieving this because they don’t have a well-documented sales process.
A B2B sales playbook can resolve this issue by clearly defining the sales objectives, which the marketing team can well understand. As a result, both teams can collaborate seamlessly without hindering the other team’s activities.
According to HubSpot, sales reps spend only one-third of their time selling. Sales managers should provide them with all possible resources to make the most of this time. Instead of biting around the bush, sales reps should focus on identifying stellar strategies to stand out in the competition.
A sales playbook contains unlimited resources and tips that simplify reps' jobs. From highly convertible sales pitch templates to discovery questions, it has everything a rep might need for their day-to-day sales activities. Hence, a B2B sales playbook can save sales reps time and help them focus more on selling.
The structure of a B2B sales playbook can vary from organization to organization. However, some common sections should be part of any B2B sales playbook:
A B2B sales playbook must contain all company information. Some of the essential organizational information to focus on are:
A good sales playbook must provide extensive information about products and pricing. Sales professionals are responsible for communicating pricing information with potential customers. Hence, this information is a must to simplify this communication for them.
Some of the pointers to include in this section are as follows:
This is the essential aspect of creating a B2B sales playbook.
In the sales process section, you must include all the tactics and technologies to follow throughout the B2B sales cycle. For example, if the first stage of the B2B sales cycle is lead generation, the sales playbook should discuss the tried and tested ways to generate leads for the organization. This could mean cold calling, cold emailing, cold social media outreach, etc.
Sales methodology on the other hand, sales methodology is the way to approach the prospects. Sales teams should include the sales best practices in this section to help the new reps. Some of the common factors to include in this section are:
Cover sales methodologies and processes as broadly as possible so that there are is no room for doubt.
Sales reps should have in-depth information about who they are selling to. Some of the information about potential customers that should be part of your B2B sales playbook are as follows:
This information will help the sales reps to understand the prospects inside-out. Hence, they can interact with the prospects confidently during sales calls and answer their questions thoroughly.
This section mentions the KPIs that your sales team should focus on. These could be deal size, lead conversion to generation ratio, time to close a deal etc. Once the reps know about the target KPIs, it will be easier for them to understand the expectations of the sales process.
Here are the main steps to follow for creating the ideal B2B sales playbook for your organization:
USP or Unique Selling Point is what differentiates your brand from the competitors. The sooner your target buyers are aware of the USP, the easier will be the decision-making process for them. So, the first and foremost step to creating a sales playbook is to find out the USP of your brand.
Some of the best ways to identify your USP quickly are as follows:
The next critical part of a sales playbook is to include the target buyer profile. A buyer profile or user persona must include as much detail about the target buyers as possible. For example, include industry type, company size, key decision-makers, location, pain points, etc.
Wondering where to get all this information? The key is to conduct in-depth user research. Here are a few research tips for creating a detailed buyer persona:
Preparing the ideal sales playbook requires both time and effort. Make sure to assign the right tasks to the right owners. Here are some of the key people who can play major roles in creating your sales playbook:
B2B sales representatives need to participate in various outbound activities like cold calling, cold emailing, social media outreach and so on. A playbook should include scripts for these outbound activities. Senior sales professionals can help in creating convertible scripts for new sales reps. In fact, a smart way to approach this is through creating a reusable template that reps can customize as per requirements.
An “ultimate” sales playbook doesn’t exist. Sales trends are changing, and accordingly, the sales playbook must also change. Hence, updating the sales playbook regularly is a good practice. As your business grows, there will be new opportunities to explore, new prospects to meet and new objections to handle. Sales teams should continue to update these factors in the sales playbook to make it a valuable resource.

B2B Sales is a sales category that involves selling products and services to another business. Unlike business-to-consumer (B2C) sales, where a business sells its products directly to customers, B2B sale is a sale between two businesses. Typically, the B2B sales process is lengthy, involves multiple stakeholders, and is of high dollar value. To successfully execute a B2B sales process, businesses require collaboration among multiple stakeholders, both within and outside the organization.
Selling in B2B is different from B2C in the following ways:
B2B sales process involves multiple stakeholders and touchpoints. As a result, it is complex and reps face the following challenges:
B2B sales is such that it involves multiple stakeholders, with multiple needs and concerns. This makes B2B sales chaotic and unstructured. The sales process is largely dependent on the target customer and hence sales reps often find B2B sales complicated. However, one can reduce the chaos by following these steps:
Your sales playbook should list these steps clearly to maintain an organized sales process, end-to-end.
B2B sales reps are expected to leverage prospect data in their favor. However, with too many datasets available, reps are often overwhelmed and confused about how to make the most of these datasets. The result? A situation of data overload.
Hence, sales representatives should be provided with relevant data using suitable tools so that they can reap the benefits of complex customer data and develop a customized sales pitch.
The average length of a B2B sales cycle is 102 days. That’s because B2B sales cycles involve multiple stakeholders, stages, and multiple touchpoints. In fact, it is very common in B2B sales for a prospect to reside in the awareness stage of the funnel for months. By focusing on building long-term relationships with the prospects, the sales reps can reduce the length of the sales cycle and move the prospects down the funnel faster.
A B2B sales representative is a professional who applies specialized selling strategies to connect with and engage business decision-makers. Corporate buyers start their buying process with thorough industry research. Hence, B2B sales reps have to be well-informed about the ideal customer profile, their motivations, needs, and concerns and must be aware of the competitive products available in the market to influence the prospects’ decision-making process.
The responsibilities of B2B sales reps include:
Because of the nature of the sales process, businesses need a well-organized sales strategy to build a successful B2B sales process. A B2B sales cycle involves the following seven steps:
Research is the cornerstone of a successful selling process. Before engaging in a sales call, a sales rep should know the following:
Though marketing and sales enablement teams provide reps with the necessary information, it is also imperative that the reps themselves conduct or be involved in the research of the prospects. They must know their ideal customer profile, their needs, motivations, concerns, and key decision-makers to positively influence outcomes.
Some of the common questions to get started with the research are as follows:
Reps should find answers to these questions and brainstorm the ideas with other team members before kickstarting the sales process.
Generating new leads is not enough if you cannot engage them. Sales prospecting is a critical step in the B2B sales method as it aims at engaging prospects who are interested in your products.
There are various ways to identify high-intent prospects for your business. One of the easiest ways is to use a real-time sales intelligence tool like Salesken. It helps sales professionals to detect prospects’ emotions in real-time and craft/alter their sales pitches accordingly.
Hence, with such a call analytics tool by your side, it becomes easier for your sales team to detect ideal customer profiles based on the intent match. Furthermore, you can allocate resources to high-intent leads to ensure maximum revenue.
After the prospecting stage, you need to perform a need assessment to narrow down your target customers. This stage aims to decide whether the potential customers’ needs actually match your solutions.
Usually, it is standard practice for sales reps to ask questions to the prospects. These questions should be open-ended and must encourage the customer to talk and express their needs and concerns. This step is particularly crucial because the sales reps formulate the pitch based on the findings of this stage. Additionally, this step can help reps anticipate objections from clients and prepare suitable negotiation strategies.
Some of the common questions to ask in this stage are as follows:
Now that you know that the potential customer’s intent and need match your solution, it is time to craft a unique sales pitch that adds sufficient value to influence a corporate buyer’s purchase decision. Generally, sales reps try to initiate a conversation with the prospects by connecting their needs with the features of a product.
Want to add an edge to your sales pitch? Check out how Salesken’s Voice of Customer Analytics can help you identify the needs and concerns of your prospects, and proactively address them in the pitch.
As soon as a sales rep starts a demo call, it is common for the prospects to ask questions and raise objections. The reps must be able to handle all concerns of the prospect satisfactorily to move the leads down the funnel.
Sales reps should remember that objections are pretty common in any sales, and must be well prepared to handle these objections.
A good practice to handle rejections/objections is to be empathetic. Empathy is a great sales skill that helps the reps to approach a solution from prospects’ perspectives. As a result, they can handle objections without getting affected.
With Salesken’s real-time assistance, reps can now know the best response to each objection. Salesken’s state-of-the-art emotion detection engine helps them know if the prospects were satisfied with the response and they can craft their pitch accordingly.
Conversion/closing is by far the most important stage in the B2B sales process. 34% of sales professionals admit that converting leads is becoming more and more challenging. This is where the sales team and target audience finalize a deal. The effectiveness of this step largely depends on the preceding steps.
The conversion step of the B2B sales process must include the following tasks:
Sometimes, B2B sales processes don’t end up in conversion. The prospects can ghost your sales representatives at the last minute. It is imperative that sales reps are prepared for such eventualities and adopt suitable strategies to ensure they meet their revenue goals.
Did you convert a lead successfully? Well, it only means that a new door of opportunity is open. B2B sales is all about adding add-on features to existing solutions and up-selling/cross-selling new services to the customers to drive higher revenue. A great way to convert one-time B2B buyers into repeat customers is to consistently follow up with them, understand their requirements, and pitch the appropriate solutions.
A critical concept associated with B2B sales is the B2B sales funnel. Unlike the sales rep-focused sales process, the B2B sales funnel is largely customer-centric. As a sales rep, it is a must that you are properly aware of all the steps of the B2B sales funnel:
This stage aims to introduce a prospect to your company and its offerings. This stage aims to create brand awareness and make the target companies curious to explore your products and services.
The second stage of the B2B sales funnel is all about building interest. If you can successfully build interest, prospects will be more and more interested in your brand and start their market research. It is the very stage where prospects will start asking questions about pricing, timeline, deliverables, etc.
If a prospect reaches the desired stage, they are already impressed by your offerings. Now they are planning to buy from you and are connecting with you for that.
A prospect who is in the intent stage of the B2B sales funnel is willing to purchase from you. However, they are still confused about which product/service offered by you will match their requirements.
Evaluation is a critical stage of any B2B sales funnel. This is where a prospect performs in-depth evaluation of your product and takes the final call on whether or not the product is suitable for them.
It is the final stage of the B2B sales funnel where the prospect decides whether or not they would purchase your product.
The secret to successful B2B sales is to adopt suitable strategies. Here are some factors to make B2B sales successful:

A good B2B salesperson must possess the following skills: (Social selling expertise, High empathy, Active listening skills, In-depth research skills, Be a team-player, Account-based sales skills)
B2B sales is difficult but not impossible. Here are some easy steps to overcome B2B sales challenges:
Your sales and marketing teams should go hand-in-hand. If your sales and marketing teams are not on the same page, you could lose up to 10% of revenue every year.

The world is evolving every day, and so are our ways of interaction. We live in a age where business deals happen over social media chat boxes. Some people are still using traditional methods like cold calling in a world ruled by digital marketing. Cold calling involves selling to prospects through unsolicited phone calls.
But does cold calling work?
Cold calling can be a daunting process because they are not always received well by people. Cold callers have a reputation for being annoying and intrusive. Most of them find their way to people's block list. So why isn’t cold calling dead already?
The statistics below paint an interesting picture:
All these statistics confirm that cold calling is very much alive, and how! Many businesses or salespeople back out from cold calling for fear of being rejected or mistreated. This is probably because you don’t know the right way to approach prospects.
Well, don’t worry because we will show you how you can ace your cold calling game with the help of six tried and tested steps.
Let’s dive in!
Here are some tips that will come in handy for sales teams to ace their cold calling game:
One of the greatest mistakes you can make while cold calling is not caring enough to know about your prospect. Some salespeople call random people whose numbers they find on local directories. If you start calling random people, there’s a high chance that you’ll be rejected, leaving you discouraged.
Always make an effort to learn relevant information about your prospect before calling. So that while you are on the call, you can bring it up to get their attention in a personalized way.
For example, if you offer a recruiting service, you may say, “Hey Miss/Mr X, we have been following your posts for a while and noticed that you are looking for a communication coordinator in your office…”
Personalizing your calls will make your prospect feel valued and important. It will give the impression that you are invested in offering a solution to them through your service or products and not just calling them to feed your sales figure.
Pressing that record button and recording your call will help you analyze your conversation technique and improve your performance. This is especially true during the initial days of cold calling, as you might make certain mistakes. Listening to your call records will help you self reflect.
You can figure out where you went right or wrong. For instance, when the customer lost interest or what topic triggered their interest and so on. It is a great way to improve your skills and strategise your next steps. Your cold calling success rates can significantly increase if you strategise your conversation and plan your moves well.
A tool that can help you here is Salesken. This speech analytics tool can analyze all the recorded conversations between reps and prospects and identify the key areas for improvement. An intent-based lead scoring process can help you distinguish between valuable and non-valuable leads. Therefore, it becomes easier to identify the right leads and engage with them over cold calling. The chances of conversion are higher.

Now that you have analysed all your call records, you have a fair idea about how people react, what questions they ask, and what triggers their interest. Call success will depend on how well you present your motive and answer the prospect’s questions with precision.
The next best thing you can do is gather and list all the important analyses from your call records, and prepare a script. Practice your script so you sound natural and engaging and not robotic.
Most people are probably busy and are less likely to pick up the call or engage in any form of conversation if you call them at the wrong time. Do your research and figure out a suitable calling time that works for both of you.
You can research their working hours, holidays and break time. Prospects will probably not talk with you during office hours but can spare a few seconds during their breaks. An Inside sales study found that Wednesdays and Thursdays are the best days where prospects are likely to engage with your call.
The first few seconds are crucial in a cold calling. It determines whether the prospect will hang up or continue talking to you. And it all depends on the way you introduce the motive of the call. Don’t beat around the bush, don’t pitch in too early. Be personal, be polite and be direct. Address the prospect on a first name basis adding a suitable title. For example, “Good evening Mr X or Miss Y,” where ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are their first name.
People will directly disconnect your call if your reason for calling doesn’t seem compelling enough. Be enthusiastic with your greeting and introduce the subject of your call to trigger their interest. The call's success will depend on your ability to attract your prospect in the initial seconds of the call.
One of the greatest mistakes you can make while cold calling is pitching too early or too late. Pitching too early can come off as desperate and self-centred, and late pitching can risk not getting to the point and boring your potential customers.
To figure out the most suitable pitching time, begin by introducing the motive of the call. Then, bring up the prospect’s problems or needs and introduce your pitch in the form of a solution that you are offering. There is no point in dragging the conversation longer. Your prospects have spared a few seconds of their valuable time to listen to you, try to make it worthwhile and short.
To close a deal successfully, every cold caller has to get past certain roadblocks. We will be discussing the three important factors that can come in the way of your call's success and how to address them.
When you try calling a senior executive, you may have to get past their assistants or receptionists. Their role is to ensure that only valid and important calls are forwarded to the executives to avoid wasting any time. Be confident, direct and concise while interacting with them. Present an image of someone important with a legitimate reason to connect. The assistant will be bound to divert the call to the executive.
Follow up calls are crucial. Many times prospects ask you to call on a different date. In the interim, the potential customer may lose interest in your offering or completely forget about your existence.
The follow-up call is as important as the first call. You may have to get past the assistants again. Hark back to the previous time you spoke, refresh their memory a little and continue to talk with confidence.
Never seem desperate or pushy while trying to close the deal. This can make your prospect uncomfortable. Keep them intrigued and position the deal in a way that seems attractive to them. If the prospects seem hesitant, offer them incentives in the form of discounts or promotional codes. This can take you towards the final point of closing the deal successfully.
Cold calling is still a relevant method for closing important deals. While rejections and disappointments are par for the course and you will not get a successful deal in every cold calling process, it’s still an effective method. It is just a matter of strategy and planning. Once you learn how to cold call properly, there is no one to stop you and your business from reaching new heights!
‍Salesken can help you improve your cold calling success in a more precise, scientific way. To know more, book a free demo!
Cold calling is an attempt to call a stranger, unsolicited, for the first time. In sales, you should ideally make a cold call after in-depth research about a prospect so that the possibilities of conversion are higher.
Cold calling is a good way to generate leads. However, cold calling should be done ethically.

Marketing and sales strategy play a key role in the growth of any business. However, creating a streamlined strategy that focuses on sales and marketing can be daunting.
Developing a sales strategy is not as challenging as it sounds. There are many businesses out there that developed and implemented stellar sales strategies. Some of the most popular names are HubSpot, Shopify, Apple, and the list goes on.
We have come up with a comprehensive guide to show you how some of the most recognized brands have aced their sales and marketing activities with innovative strategies.
A sales strategy is a plan to help the sales reps understand the business objectives and develop their sales process accordingly. In addition, a targeted sales strategy simplifies activities like competitor analysis, market research, and product positioning.
Here are a few sales strategies and examples that can come in handy for businesses:
Value-based selling is one of the most used sales strategies of all time. A brand adopting this sales strategy positions its products and services based on perceived value. With value-based selling, brands focus on the benefit rather than the product.
Shopify is one of the largest eCommerce platforms. Since the very beginning of its sales journey, Shopify has been successfully implementing a value-based sales strategy. If you visit Shopify’s website, you’ll notice how this brand has summarized all the value it can add to the customers through its services.

The “Home page” of this platform appeals to the visitors with the top benefits it can offer like:
Shopify further adds social proof from existing customers to establish that it lives up to its promises. One of the customer testimonials on the Shopify website says,
Social selling is one of the most emerging sales approaches.
Under this sales strategy, brands interact with their prospects, nurture relationships and convert prospects into qualified through social media platforms.
Social selling is a fresh take on modern networking and relationship-building. It can replace traditional sales techniques like cold calling and engage prospects in meaningful conversations. LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms to practice social selling.
Social selling is not just about persuading prospects to buy from your brand. It is more about using social media throughout a prospect’s user journey and navigating them across different sales funnel stages.

A brand that does social selling pretty well is - Nike.
If you check Nike’s Instagram account, you will notice how this brand:
All these make Nike a top favorite among consumers.
Challenger sales strategy is a fast-growing approach that depends on the sales scenario, the sales rep, and the target customer. According to this sales strategy, the sales rep needs to take full ownership of the sales process and offer the customer a personalized benefit for a specific situation.
A challenger sales rep purposefully creates tension in the customers’ minds and forces them to develop a fresh perspective. This sales strategy focuses on solving a strange problem for the prospects. This sales methodology is particularly effective in long, complex B2B sales cycles.
ConvertFlow is a funnel-builder tool for eCommerce stores. This brand has adopted a challenger sales strategy in the following manner:
A targeted marketing strategy should back a powerful sales strategy. When sales and marketing go hand-in-hand, success is on the cards.
Here are a few marketing models and strategies that can make a difference:
User-generated content (also known as UGC) is brand-specific content created by users and published on different social media channels, emails, landing pages, etc. UGC can be of different types, including images, testimonials, reviews, videos, podcasts, etc.
UGC can come from customers, employees, and loyalists. It is useful across different stages of the buyer's journey. High-quality UGC can boost engagement and drive conversions.
GoPro, one of the leading video equipment brands, has been using UGC for years. The YouTube channel of this brand features videos created only by its customers. As a result, some of the top user-generated videos have acquired millions of views for this brand on YouTube.
GoPro has taken UGC to another level. Currently, this brand organizes award shows and promotes photo challenges to encourage customers to click creative pictures using GoPro products.
A great marketing strategy, often useful for lead nurturing, is running retargeting campaigns. The purpose of retargeting campaigns is to reach out to the people who have already visited your website and nurture them to complete their purchases.
HubSpot is a winning name when it comes to retargeting campaigns. Notice this retargeting ad by HubSpot below:

See how HubSpot adds a relevant image and copy to directly address a common pain point of their target customers - setting up a sales CRM tool. This brand knows that CRM tools take forever to set up, and most advertisers are hesitant to make a purchase decision.
HubSpot’s ad tries to end this dilemma by assuring that it takes only 25 seconds to set up and saves up a lot of time in the long run. This can quickly grab users’ attention and persuade them to click on your ad.
The Internet is filled with numerous marketing and sales strategies. What works for one brand might not necessarily work for others. Hence, it is difficult to identify which strategy will be fit for which situation.
Therefore, no matter which sales strategy you select from the above list, ensure that it is aligned with your target audiences and market. Also, you can personalize each strategy based on your business requirements and make it your own.
Also, when it comes to sales, make sure that you have the right stack of sales tools. These sales tools can simplify the implementation of your sales strategies and fulfill your sales goals.

Marketing and sales strategy play a key role in the growth of any business. However, creating a streamlined strategy that focuses on sales and marketing can be daunting.
Developing a sales strategy is not as challenging as it sounds. There are many businesses out there that developed and implemented stellar sales strategies. Some of the most popular names are HubSpot, Shopify, Apple, and the list goes on.
We have come up with a comprehensive guide to show you how some of the most recognized brands have aced their sales and marketing activities with innovative strategies.
A sales strategy is a plan to help the sales reps understand the business objectives and develop their sales process accordingly. In addition, a targeted sales strategy simplifies activities like competitor analysis, market research, and product positioning.
Here are a few sales strategies and examples that can come in handy for businesses:
Value-based selling is one of the most used sales strategies of all time. A brand adopting this sales strategy positions its products and services based on perceived value. With value-based selling, brands focus on the benefit rather than the product.
Shopify is one of the largest eCommerce platforms. Since the very beginning of its sales journey, Shopify has been successfully implementing a value-based sales strategy. If you visit Shopify’s website, you’ll notice how this brand has summarized all the value it can add to the customers through its services.

The “Home page” of this platform appeals to the visitors with the top benefits it can offer like:
Shopify further adds social proof from existing customers to establish that it lives up to its promises. One of the customer testimonials on the Shopify website says,
Social selling is one of the most emerging sales approaches.
Under this sales strategy, brands interact with their prospects, nurture relationships and convert prospects into qualified through social media platforms.
Social selling is a fresh take on modern networking and relationship-building. It can replace traditional sales techniques like cold calling and engage prospects in meaningful conversations. LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms to practice social selling.
Social selling is not just about persuading prospects to buy from your brand. It is more about using social media throughout a prospect’s user journey and navigating them across different sales funnel stages.
Source
A brand that does social selling pretty well is - Nike.
If you check Nike’s Instagram account, you will notice how this brand:
All these make Nike a top favorite among consumers.
Challenger sales strategy is a fast-growing approach that depends on the sales scenario, the sales rep, and the target customer. According to this sales strategy, the sales rep needs to take full ownership of the sales process and offer the customer a personalized benefit for a specific situation.
A challenger sales rep purposefully creates tension in the customers’ minds and forces them to develop a fresh perspective. This sales strategy focuses on solving a strange problem for the prospects. This sales methodology is particularly effective in long, complex B2B sales cycles.
ConvertFlow is a funnel-builder tool for eCommerce stores. This brand has adopted a challenger sales strategy in the following manner:
A targeted marketing strategy should back a powerful sales strategy. When sales and marketing go hand-in-hand, success is on the cards.
Here are a few marketing models and strategies that can make a difference:
User-generated content (also known as UGC) is brand-specific content created by users and published on different social media channels, emails, landing pages, etc. UGC can be of different types, including images, testimonials, reviews, videos, podcasts, etc.
UGC can come from customers, employees, and loyalists. It is useful across different stages of the buyer's journey. High-quality UGC can boost engagement and drive conversions.
GoPro, one of the leading video equipment brands, has been using UGC for years. The YouTube channel of this brand features videos created only by its customers. As a result, some of the top user-generated videos have acquired millions of views for this brand on YouTube.
GoPro has taken UGC to another level. Currently, this brand organizes award shows and promotes photo challenges to encourage customers to click creative pictures using GoPro products.
A great marketing strategy, often useful for lead nurturing, is running retargeting campaigns. The purpose of retargeting campaigns is to reach out to the people who have already visited your website and nurture them to complete their purchases.
HubSpot is a winning name when it comes to retargeting campaigns. Notice this retargeting ad by HubSpot below:

See how HubSpot adds a relevant image and copy to directly address a common pain point of their target customers - setting up a sales CRM tool. This brand knows that CRM tools take forever to set up, and most advertisers are hesitant to make a purchase decision.
HubSpot’s ad tries to end this dilemma by assuring that it takes only 25 seconds to set up and saves up a lot of time in the long run. This can quickly grab users’ attention and persuade them to click on your ad.
The Internet is filled with numerous marketing and sales strategies. What works for one brand might not necessarily work for others. Hence, it is difficult to identify which strategy will be fit for which situation.
Therefore, no matter which sales strategy you select from the above list, ensure that it is aligned with your target audiences and market. Also, you can personalize each strategy based on your business requirements and make it your own.
Also, when it comes to sales, make sure that you have the right stack of sales tools. These sales tools can simplify the implementation of your sales strategies and fulfill your sales goals.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a type of cloud software that companies host and make available for their customers over the internet. SaaS businesses opt for a subscription-based model, and unlike regular applications, you cannot download these solutions on your computer or mobile devices.
The global SaaS sector is further bifurcated into two segments: Business-to-Consumer (B2C) SaaS and Business-to-Business (B2B) SaaS. B2C SaaS focuses on developing direct customer solutions, while B2B SaaS creates software solutions for businesses.
The global B2B SaaS industry has grown exponentially over the past decade. As per projection, this industry will be worth $307 billion by 2026. There is sufficient room for growth and opportunities for new SaaS companies planning to step into this industry. However, B2B SaaS sales techniques, pricing strategies, and metrics are different and tricky. Sales professionals trying to master B2B SaaS sales should clearly understand these factors to create their sales pitch.
Here is a comprehensive B2B SaaS guide that highlights tried and tested techniques to gain expertise in B2B SaaS sales. We are confident that you’ll have several actionable points to develop your SaaS sales strategy by the time you complete reading this guide.
B2B SaaS is software that is typically sold to businesses and not customers. For example, suppose you own an eCommerce store. To run this store successfully, you need to manage several activities like warehousing, inventory planning, marketing, shipping, invoicing, etc. An entrepreneur can't handle all these aspects manually.
So what’s the solution?
As the founder, you can subscribe to different B2B SaaS solutions capable of managing all these functions individually. You can get Zoho for inventory management and Browntape for shipping management. All these solutions are quickly accessible via the cloud. Most of these B2B SaaS solutions have been designed with a complete focus on the problems faced by eCommerce stores. Hence, customers can enjoy several customised services and add-on features as well.
The global B2B SaaS market is evolving rapidly. Some of the critical trends visible in this industry are as follows:
Source
B2B SaaS sales involve selling SaaS solutions to small, medium, and large businesses. Sales reps involved in SaaS sales focus on generating and converting new leads or retaining existing clients through upselling. The target customers of B2B SaaS sales are C-suite executives, so reps working in this industry should be highly skilled and knowledgeable about closing sales deals.
One of the biggest differences between traditional sales and B2B SaaS sales is that sales cycles are longer due to the involvement of multiple touchpoints, leading to greater complexity. Sales deals are also highly expensive.
Successful B2B SaaS sales deals require active collaboration between marketing and sales teams. Marketing teams nurture prospects and convert them into Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), and sales teams take the next steps to turn these leads into Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs).
Sales reps need to communicate the benefits and features of a SaaS solution to the prospects and explain how it can address their pain points. That’s the only way to stand out in the field of B2B SaaS selling.
B2B SaaS sales require targeted research, attention to detail, and deep product knowledge. Here are a few tips that can help the reps to close more SaaS sales deals in 2022:
Entrepreneurs dominate the B2B SaaS market by focusing largely on personalisation. If an organisation has a large portfolio of multiple products, the scope of conversion can be reduced. Specialisation and a targeted offering will help you win potential customers’ trust. From a sales point of view, it’s also easier for reps to project their brand as an expert in that industry.
For instance, think of Slack in the global B2B SaaS sector, which dominates business messaging. Slack has a small and targeted portfolio of services. This brand solely focuses on instant business messaging, video conferencing, and productivity bots. This strategy has won Slack the reputation as the #1 business messaging platform.
Similarly, B2B SaaS companies should begin with one compelling core offering and explore additional features eventually. The main elements of this approach are as follows:
There are two different marketing approaches. The first is a push strategy where brands push the prospects with useful information and expect their presence. The second is the pull strategy, where companies provide specific information to the buyers so that they become interested and are drawn in automatically to take action.
A push strategy is all about advertising and promotions. It is costly but effective to some extent. Alternatively, a pull strategy is all about offering value and generating organic interest. You may offer useful resources to the customers to pull them in, such as eBooks, datasheets, whitepapers, blogs, etc. The idea is to provide the buyers with the information they are looking for to automatically come to your website, searching for more.
While both types of marketing work for B2B SaaS brands, we are slightly aligned toward the pull strategy. It is cost-effective and focuses on relationship-building rather than simply encouraging sales.
‍B2B SaaS sales is tricky and selling the advanced features of a product is not sufficient to impress prospects. To create a long-lasting impression, sales reps should focus on solving a problem faced by the customers. That’s how potential customers will realise the value of your product and become interested.
Here are some crucial steps to master this trick:
For any B2B SaaS company, the sales and marketing teams must make a joint effort to close more deals. A great way the marketing team can assist sales teams in this journey is through content, so B2B SaaS companies should invest in content marketing from the very beginning. On average, B2B buyers consume 13 pieces of content before making a purchase decision. But as of 2020, only 43% of B2B marketers have a documented content strategy in place.
Source
Targeted content marketing educates the prospects and provides them with sufficient knowledge about your product. By investing in content marketing, brands provide the prospects with all the resources they need to evaluate their services before making a decision.
With content marketing, half of the sales reps' jobs are already done. They can directly approach the prospects for the next steps.
There are various types of content that B2B SaaS companies can leverage. Some top choices include:
SaaS companies can drive traffic through powerful content marketing. They can also distribute and repurpose core content messages across their various platforms, like Medium, Quora, Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.
Offering a “free trial” option can do wonders in B2B SaaS sales. Over 65% of SaaS companies have made free trials a part of their sales strategy. This will help potential customers try your product and figure out whether the product will meet their requirements or not.
Many organisations hesitate to offer free trials as it would increase their customer acquisition costs. However, a brief trial period of 7 to 14 days can work in their favour. Most customers don’t even complete the trial period if they don’t like the SaaS product. Hence, it becomes easier for sales teams to differentiate between high intent and low intent prospects. They can follow up only with prospects who stick to the product till the end of the trial period. This means a reduced SaaS sales cycle and significant savings in customer acquisition costs.
Also, when you are offering a trial package, it doesn’t have to be completely feature-packed. You can create a bundle of best and average features and offer it as a free trial. You can keep on adding and removing features depending on customers’ responses.
B2B SaaS selling is different from regular sales, and hence, it is wise for sales teams to invest in training the reps. A B2B SaaS sales analytics and coaching platform like Salesken can help you in this process. It will help sales teams with the following:
Book a demo to explore further!
Focusing on value addition can make a difference in B2B SaaS sales. If you can make the B2B buyers realise that your product can solve their problems, they will perceive your product as “valuable”.
And how do you generate value? By solving the customers’ problems.
Thorough research into easily available resources can help sales reps gain a lot of information about their target audience. Some quick sources to find information include their website, individual LinkedIn profiles of key decision-makers, and review platforms like Capterra, Trustpilot etc.
The information you collect from these platforms can help you understand the customer’s pain points, making it easier to find a solution. A little research can help B2B SaaS sales teams save time and money.
Once you develop a B2B SaaS solution, the next big challenge is to sell it. B2B SaaS sales are long and complicated and experienced and knowledgeable sales reps have higher chances of success. To recap, start with research, build and nurture relationships, align the marketing and sales teams and concentrate on a “pull” strategy (including content creation) as much as possible to master B2B SaaS sales.
As described, Salesken is a game-changer for B2B SaaS sales. Book a demo to explore further!
B2B SaaS sales are about selling software to businesses. This software is hosted in the cloud, accessible online, and can be personalised based on requirements.
Unlike regular B2C sales, SaaS sales are different because you have to build relationships with customers, develop their interests, solve the problems they are facing, and then approach them to buy a product.

Similarly, B2B SaaS companies should begin with one compelling core offering and explore additional features eventually. The main elements of this approach are as follows:
There are two different marketing approaches. The first is a push strategy where brands push the prospects with useful information and expect their presence. The second is the pull strategy, where companies provide specific information to the buyers so that they become interested and are drawn in automatically to take action.
A push strategy is all about advertising and promotions. It is costly but effective to some extent. Alternatively, a pull strategy is all about offering value and generating organic interest. You may offer useful resources to the customers to pull them in, such as eBooks, datasheets, whitepapers, blogs, etc. The idea is to provide the buyers with the information they are looking for to automatically come to your website, searching for more.
While both types of marketing work for B2B SaaS brands, we are slightly aligned toward the pull strategy. It is cost-effective and focuses on relationship-building rather than simply encouraging sales.
‍B2B SaaS sales is tricky and selling the advanced features of a product is not sufficient to impress prospects. To create a long-lasting impression, sales reps should focus on solving a problem faced by the customers. That’s how potential customers will realise the value of your product and become interested.
Here are some crucial steps to master this trick:
For any B2B SaaS company, the sales and marketing teams must make a joint effort to close more deals. A great way the marketing team can assist sales teams in this journey is through content, so B2B SaaS companies should invest in content marketing from the very beginning. On average, B2B buyers consume 13 pieces of content before making a purchase decision. But as of 2020, only 43% of B2B marketers have a documented content strategy in place.

Targeted content marketing educates the prospects and provides them with sufficient knowledge about your product. By investing in content marketing, brands provide the prospects with all the resources they need to evaluate their services before making a decision.
With content marketing, half of the sales reps' jobs are already done. They can directly approach the prospects for the next steps.
There are various types of content that B2B SaaS companies can leverage. Some top choices include:
SaaS companies can drive traffic through powerful content marketing. They can also distribute and repurpose core content messages across their various platforms, like Medium, Quora, Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.
Offering a “free trial” option can do wonders in B2B SaaS sales. Over 65% of SaaS companies have made free trials a part of their sales strategy. This will help potential customers try your product and figure out whether the product will meet their requirements or not.
Many organisations hesitate to offer free trials as it would increase their customer acquisition costs. However, a brief trial period of 7 to 14 days can work in their favour. Most customers don’t even complete the trial period if they don’t like the SaaS product. Hence, it becomes easier for sales teams to differentiate between high intent and low intent prospects. They can follow up only with prospects who stick to the product till the end of the trial period. This means a reduced SaaS sales cycle and significant savings in customer acquisition costs.
Also, when you are offering a trial package, it doesn’t have to be completely feature-packed. You can create a bundle of best and average features and offer it as a free trial. You can keep on adding and removing features depending on customers’ responses.
B2B SaaS selling is different from regular sales, and hence, it is wise for sales teams to invest in training the reps. A B2B SaaS sales analytics and coaching platform like Salesken can help you in this process. It will help sales teams with the following:

Focusing on value addition can make a difference in B2B SaaS sales. If you can make the B2B buyers realise that your product can solve their problems, they will perceive your product as “valuable”.
And how do you generate value? By solving the customers’ problems.
Thorough research into easily available resources can help sales reps gain a lot of information about their target audience. Some quick sources to find information include their website, individual LinkedIn profiles of key decision-makers, and review platforms like Capterra, Trustpilot etc.
The information you collect from these platforms can help you understand the customer’s pain points, making it easier to find a solution. A little research can help B2B SaaS sales teams save time and money.
Once you develop a B2B SaaS solution, the next big challenge is to sell it. B2B SaaS sales are long and complicated and experienced and knowledgeable sales reps have higher chances of success. To recap, start with research, build and nurture relationships, align the marketing and sales teams and concentrate on a “pull” strategy (including content creation) as much as possible to master B2B SaaS sales.
As described, Salesken is a game-changer for B2B SaaS sales. Book a demo to explore further!
B2B SaaS sales are about selling software to businesses. This software is hosted in the cloud, accessible online, and can be personalised based on requirements.
Unlike regular B2C sales, SaaS sales are different because you have to build relationships with customers, develop their interests, solve the problems they are facing, and then approach them to buy a product.

Software-as-a-service or SaaS companies host their cloud-based applications over the internet and allow their customers to use them. The global SaaS sector is growing fast and is expected to reach $400 billion by 2025. So it’s time for the SaaS salespeople to sharpen up their SaaS sales skills as they try to acquire new customers and up sell or cross sell to their existing customers and improve their organisations’ business.
In this blog, we have put together everything related to SaaS sales in one place. Whether you’re a sales rep, manager, or SaaS entrepreneur, this guide can help you master the art of SaaS selling in a few steps.
SaaS sales is all about selling cloud-based software applications to clients. Sales reps in the SaaS industry focus on applying unique B2B SaaS sales strategies to convert new customers and nurture existing customers. The key factors related to SaaS sales are customer service and personalization. The right combination of these two factors can help you boost your SaaS sales activities.
A SaaS sales cycle depends on various factors like customer segment, price of products, and product complexity. Complex SaaS products typically have longer sales cycles as more stakeholders get involved in the sales process Here are some factors that typically control your SaaS sales cycle:
The global SaaS market is evolving every day. Sales reps need to keep up with these trends to make the SaaS sales experience seamless. However, keeping up with the latest SaaS trends can be time-consuming. You need time to educate your sales reps on the best practices in the SaaS industry before they start communicating with the prospects. This can impact the length of the sales cycle of your SaaS organisation.
Is your SaaS product a complex one? That can also be the reason behind a long SaaS sales cycle. For complex SaaS products, reps need a significant amount of time to execute product demos and explain the prospects features of the product which can take up a lot of time.
Before building a B2B SaaS sales strategy, you must figure out who your target customers are. For example, if your target customers are large enterprises, your SaaS sales cycle is likely to get longer. That’s because the SaaS sales process, in that case, includes several steps which would involve multiple stakeholders from the buying organization.
Many SaaS businesses offer free trials to their prospects. While this is a good strategy, it has its own challenges. For instance, if you’re offering a 30-day free trial, you’re simply increasing the length of your SaaS sales cycle by 30 days.
Typically, the average length of a SaaS sales cycle is 84 days. However, it can vary depending on the Annual Contract Value (ACV). If your ACV is less than $5K, the SaaS sales cycle may be as long as 40 days. On the contrary, for ACVs over $100K, the SaaS sales cycle can be around 170 days.
Here are a few tips to win SaaS deals like a pro: 1. Be wise with your free trial strategy 2. Master the art of delivering a SaaS product demo 3. Use a sales enablement tool 4. Never stop up-selling/cross-selling 5. Focus on customers’ feedback 6. Communicate with the prospects during the free trial period
Offering free trials is pretty common in any SaaS sales process. However, you need to understand if you are being strategic in providing a free trial policy? The whole purpose of offering a free trial is to let your customers understand the essence of your software and its benefits.
Here are some ways to provide free trials for an effectively sell SaaS products:
Want to master your SaaS sales skills? Start with delivering an outstanding SaaS product demo. An efficiently executed SaaS product demo can make your Sales process while a poorly planned demo can break it.
Here are some quick tips to deliver an effective SaaS product demo:
You can use a sales enablement tool to grow your SaaS sales process. A sales enablement tool like Salesken can leverage AI and conversational analytics to speed up your SaaS sales process. Here’s what it can do for you:

A great SaaS sales tactic is to persuade the existing customers with up-sell/cross-sell suggestions. Upselling is a great way to increase recurring revenue for your SaaS business. Your clients’ requirements keep changing and it is a wise decision to pitch new products to the existing clients to address their additional requirements.
This B2B SaaS sales strategy is apt for businesses offering multi-tier subscription plans. Each of these plans comes with separate pricing and more additional features. You can use this strategy to create a profitable SaaS sales process.
A crucial part of increasing your SaaS sales is to take customers’ feedback seriously. SaaS brands can leverage customers’ feedback to understand how efficiently they can improve their products and services. A quick feedback collection email is all it takes to ask customers about their opinion. Once you find out the results from the feedback, you can easily implement those in practice and improve your SaaS sales journey.
Don’t leave your prospects on their own during the free trial period. While you don’t want to annoy them, staying in touch with them is alright during the trial period. It is the ideal time to know customers’ feedback and incorporate them into practice for an effective SaaS sales process.
Want to track the growth of your SaaS sales process? Don’t forget to monitor the following KPIs:
Churn rate is the percentage at which your SaaS brand loses customers on a yearly basis. Here’s how you can estimate churn rate:
Churn rate = [ The total numbers of customers you have lost/ The initial numbers of customers]
Ideally, the lower the value of your churn rate, the better. If you can opt for a negative churn rate, there’s nothing like it. It simply means that you have gained more customers than you have lost in a year.
The purpose of estimating CAC is to understand how much you need to spend to acquire a new customer. You can estimate CAC with the following formula:
CAC = [ Cost of sales and marketing / Total no. of new customers]
Ideally, the lower the value of CAC, the better. CAC explains the scalability potential of your business. This metric can also help you gain proper insights into the performance of your sales and marketing team.
This KPI measures how fast your sales team is converting leads and closing contracts. Here’s how you can estimate this particular KPI:
Win Rate = [ Closed sales opportunities / (Total opportunities + Closed deals) ]
You now have a clear idea of the SaaS sales process and strategies that can improve your game.
Technology in Sales especially in SaaS sales has been playing a key role and will continue to do so in the near future. Salesken is one platform which is disrupting this space with its offerings like In call Sales intelligence and Post call analytics. It also works seamlessly with existing tools like dialers and CRMs to make sure that the performances of your Sales reps improve constantly and with that, your organization’s topline as well.

Have you ever wondered about your customer journey process and how they end up making a purchase from your organization?
A customer's journey is thoroughly mapped by a sales funnel, which outlines all the touchpoints your customers interact with your brand before they are ready to make a purchase.
Without solid sales funnel software, it is extremely tough to convert leads into paying customers and grow revenue over time.
So, where is the disconnect?
Answer - Lack of a functioning sales funnel!
To make a sale, you need to have a sales funnel in place and this is where an optimized sales funnel makes all the difference. Without one, your team might be riding high on the guesswork!
This article will cover the following -
A sales funnel is a pictorial representation of your buyer's journey right from their first interaction with your product till they make a sale.
In simple words, the sales funnel is a multi-step process that converts leads into buying customers.
A sales funnel is a marketing term that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making a purchase.
Creating a sales funnel helps sales teams identify possible loopholes in the sales process to understand where prospective customers are losing interest.
The definition of a sales funnel refers to the fact the sales process is like a pictured funnel - meaning it is widest at the top and narrowest at its bottom. Each stage of the funnel pushes your qualified leads into the next stage and pushes those that are not a fit.
A sales funnel is directly related to the customer journey phases - top, middle, and bottom of the funnel.
The sales funnel process shows that prospects go through -
As prospects pass through each stage of the funnel, they indicate a more profound commitment to their purchase goal. Most businesses use this template to guide their marketing and sales efforts at each stage of the sales funnel.
A well-defined sales funnel helps you understand your customers' interest in your product at various points of the buyer's journey.
Each step is a micro-conversion that can be optimized to increase overall conversions; if one of these steps visualizes a higher-than-expected drop-off rate to analyze what's wrong and test out possible improvements.
Tracking each stage of the funnel carefully can help you determine how each lead should be approached, which product suits them the best, and what messaging should you use to close the deal.
Getting the right communication at the right time prevents losing prospects by bombarding them with too much information, sometimes irrelevant, or giving them the hard sell too early.
78% of buyers seek salespeople who act as trusted advisors who are well-versed with their industry.
For instance, successful companies such as Spotify, Nike, and Frito Lays have taken their time to figure out a process that attracts the right leads and turns them into paying customers.
A clearly defined sales funnel provides sales reps with insights that give them ammunition to follow up with the right kind of sales activities via the right channels, which propels a lead into a buying customer.
While each business's sales funnel has its own way of managing the sales process and buyer's journey, the number of stages in your sales funnel depends on your niche, industry requirements, and more.
There are four primary stages of a sales funnel -
A sales funnel starts when a prospect becomes aware of your company, service, or product.
The awareness stage is the widest part of the funnel - this may be the first interaction they've had, maybe with your website, read your social media post, or even heard about you from existing customers.
Typically, at this stage, your potential customers are facing a challenge and are researching for solutions to solve their pain points.
They have a myriad of questions trying to verbalize their problem and look for a trusted solution.
The best way to get the prospect's attention is to generate enough interest upon initial exposure that the prospect signs up for a valuable resource free of cost in exchange for their contact information.
This will also help your team to segregate your target audience and buyer personas by gathering data and deepening your understanding of customers.
To determine which marketing efforts work the best, look at your analytics for your website and the corresponding keywords that are ranking for your audience. Leverage online marketing automation tools to gauge how well your audience is interacting with your product and the traffic it brings.
As prospects move down the funnel from the awareness stage, they'll be pushed down to the interest, or the middle of the sales funnel.
Interest equates to comparing your product with your competitors, free trial, in-depth research, and mulling over their various options.
Increasing their interest may start with online content describing topics relevant to your business's offer and, in turn, building authority and credibility with your brand.
At this stage, your potential customers shift their focus by taking steps to follow your social media channels, subscribing to your email marketing list, asking questions or even sending direct messages.
Your sales reps initiate a discovery call, sales meeting, or a demo with the potential customers to identify their challenges and explain how your product can solve their pain points.
This stage is crucial for sales teams to push the lead to convert leads and make them into paying customers.
The goal is to engage with your prospects and establish trust so they want to subscribe to your newsletter or email marketing list.
To increase the likelihood of opting for the subscription and updates from your company, focus on producing great, but relatable content for your website.
Some ways to engage leads are eBooks, free resources such as tools that will help the prospect as an incentive to join your mailing list, and more.
The final stage is the bottom of your funnel is when your customers know everything about their problem, the best type of solution for them, and are ready to make a purchase.
This is why their concerns and questions in the final stage become more specific to the vendor, following the narrowing shape of a funnel's bottom
In turn, your sales reps present a proposition, terms of the contract, and other agreements to successfully win their deal.
The outcome of this opportunity may sway either way - win or loss - depending on the prospect's interests at this stage. Although sales reps set the table for success, handling objections and negotiations, when it comes to closing the deal, win rates are quite unpredictable.
If the purchase is made, your sales rep will move the deal to the won stage in the sales process and begin onboarding the new customer.
Sometimes, leads may slip through the cracks for reasons that are beyond one's control. It is vital to keep these records in your CRM tool so you can track the reasons why the deal was lost, and nurture them in the future to win back their business.
To increase the likelihood of a sale, focus on ways you can make it easy for your potential customers to buy. As you build a perfect sales funnel, build a list of email subscribers to boost sales with various types of email marketing strategies.
Gauge how well your digital sales process is and consider testing out the checkout process to see if anything could impact the way they make the purchase.
Consider monitoring small changes to see if you can improve customer retention and conversion rate.
If your organization has been using "pipeline" and "funnel" to mean the same thing, you might want to pay attention.
Sales pipeline and sales funnel both describe the flow of potential customers through a sale, but there indeed is an important difference between the two commonly used terms.
A sales pipeline represents the stages a buyer passes before becoming a paying customer, however, a sales funnel represents the number of prospects that make it via the same stages of a funnel software.
A sales pipeline refers to the total number of possibilities, in all stages. These will be handled by your sales reps at any given time to show the quantity, value, and stages of open deals.
A sales pipeline focuses on the brand and looks internally at stages that your sales and marketing teams need to move a prospect in order to make them a customer and retain them.
Though the structure of a sales pipeline can differ from company to company, here are some of the common stages -
The sales funnel overlooks the whole customer journey, from the point of a lead.
Simply put, a sales funnel refers to the path that prospects follow to eventually become a customer.
It's called a funnel because of its visual representation - wider with new leads on top from the broadest most qualified audience, with potential buyers dropping off gradually at each stage until you reach the final number of paying customers narrows at the bottom.
A standard sales funnel has at least four stages -
A simple way to differentiate between the sales funnel and the sales pipeline is to consider the primary factor: the customer and their journey is the focus of the sales funnel whereas the sales rep and the sales process are the focus of the pipeline.
Your sales funnel is only as effective as the work you put into it.
Although some products might sell themselves, a vast majority require constant experimentation to find an effective sales funnel structure.
From defining your funnel stages to automating lead generation, as a sales manager, you can set up your sales funnel software to help your sales team advance their leads’ progress and stop them from dropping off the funnel.
Here's a blueprint of the sales funnel you can use for your business -
Businesses generate leads via a myriad of channels.
One of the best ways to speed up the sales process is by organizing and capturing leads via CRM software. It is broken down into modules to manage leads, customers, and opportunities.
The first step to set up your own sales funnel is to capture leads. For instance, leads who get in touch with you via your homepage, sales forms, leads who email you, and more.
Tag these leads based on their categories to simplify their process.
Some ways to capture leads are -
Some CRM software has the capability to capture leads who visit your website, submit a form, and even email your sales team automatically and segment them based on their categories.
This automation cuts down sales reps' time in half and helps them focus on pushing a sale, and assigns a sales rep to every lead too.
Leads that enter this stage are assigned as 'new leads', since it is at the top of the funnel, which is the broadest of the funnel.
When sales reps interact with these leads, they're automatically moved to the next stage.
A well-seasoned CRM software helps you analyze the progress of leads that have entered your sales funnel to help sales reps to plan their sales strategies effectively.
The biggest challenge for a sales manager is to be able to identify qualified sales leads.
Qualifying leads is the most critical stage in the funnel as it directly impacts the productivity of a sales team.
A seasoned sales rep probably knows how to qualify leads over time, but for the rest of them, it is still a burning issue.
The struggle to pick out the right qualified leads in the sales funnel forces a sales rep to chase all leads, irrespective of their fit.
The result - is getting nowhere.
A sales rep's time is valuable and pursuing every lead with the same effort is like shooting in the dark.
This is where CRM software can help with lead management and forecasting capability to benefit your team and save their overall time.
With the leverage of AI, sales teams can easily qualify and engage leads based on their interest and behavior to contact them via phone or email and push them further down the funnel.
Using separate tools to track and contact your leads at different stages of the funnel can be difficult and lead to errors.
Leverage CRM software to automate the process with a built-in email marketing tool and call management process via a powerful workflow.
Modern CRM software can track your emails and alert you when your lead opens the email. This can help your sales team to know when to take action and move them to the next stage.
The best sales funnel software allows you to make calls in a single click, auto-logs and records calls, and transfers call to available sales agents without the need for third-party tools.
In this stage, the customer has shown interest in purchasing your product.
A good practice when managing leads in your CRM software is to be consistent in updating the lead stage correctly.
As leads trickle down the funnel, you must be able to analyze the number of leads in your funnel to ensure there are minimum leads drop and is always full with leads. It is also extremely important to know what lead is at which stage to be prepared beforehand.
In order to close the deal, your sales reps need to persuade them with helpful resources that can aid them in making a purchase. This could include either a free trial, a demo of your product, an extended subscription, or even a discount.
At this stage, it is extremely crucial to ensure your sales team update their records at regular intervals.
An efficient CRM software can automate this whole process to simplify deal qualification in your organization.
Sales stages such as deals qualified, or appointments scheduled can be automated and keep other team members in the loop too.
Set up powerful workflows in your CRM software to fill gaps and speed up the process with automation rather than relying on manual power.
This stage of the sales funnel is extremely important. Once you move the lead further down the sales funnel, it is vital to create relevant opportunities by quantifying their value.
This is where you can leverage a sales CRM software - track and analyze each opportunity with maximum visibility.
Visual sales pipeline provides a quick overview of all stages of your sales funnel, allowing you to see how leads are moving throughout the funnel. It also provides sales reps with a quick estimate of their leads and urges them to add more leads.
Converting all leads that enter your sales funnel is a herculean task.
Not all leads are going to convert and it is a fact.
But with CRM software in place, when a potential sale falls through, all the information regarding the sale is available at fingertips - take a step back and assess what went wrong and what could have been done right.
An intuitive CRM software lets you identify the reason behind the loss and help you fill gaps in your existing sales funnel.
Create re-engagement campaigns in your CRM software and target your lost leads by providing value with an aha moment such as case studies, ebooks, webinars, and more.
The key is to make your leads feel that you were not there just to make that sale, but to nurture a relationship.
Lead nurturing is the process of actively engaging with leads via targeted campaigns. With CRM software, you can utilize tools designed especially for lead nurturing from the time they enter the sales funnel to when they make a purchase.
Your sales funnel is as effective as the work you put into it.
For a proper sales funnel to exist, you need to first identify your potential customers who can move through the funnel.
Here’s an example of how to create an ideal sales funnel for your business -
Identifying your ideal target audience is the most vital step in building an ideal sales funnel. If you do it right, you can figure -
The most important questions to ask your customers are -
Based on your data, you can create content for each stage of the funnel - ToFu, MoFu, and BoFu to help potential customers move down the funnel.
Without potential customers and people interested in your business, there is no sales funnel.
This means putting the right kind of content in front of your target audience.
Some of the most common ways to drive traffic to your business are -
Your paid ads and organic marketing need to take your prospects somewhere - this is where a landing page with a powerful CTA comes in.
If they click on an ad, sign up for your webinar, or even download a resource - they have to be redirected to a landing page.
Make sure to communicate who you are as a company and your unique benefits. Focus on capturing leads instead of making a sale.
In addition, ensure the landing page has a form to fill in their information for potential customers so you can communicate with them regarding your next step.
Now that you have captured the interest of your prospects, it is time to start a communication channel with them.
Market to your leads via email marketing by providing value and engaging content. Send updates regularly, but not too often.
At the end of your drip campaign, make an incredible offer that they cannot resist. That’s the piece of content that will push them into making a purchase.
Once your prospects turn into paying customers, do not forget about them.
Continue to reach out to them by sending useful, educational content. Thank them for their purchase and send them regular updates about any promotions or sales.
Involve them in your social media strategy and build a community for your customers to develop brand trust and loyalty.
The sales funnel essentially captures the movement of a lead through the sales process.
It’s not just a visual representation of the numbers in the form of a funnel, there’s more to it.
A sales funnel can help you analyze the number of leads who enter your funnel and the number who convert to customers and find a reason for a dip in these conversions.
While it’s impossible to convert every lead that comes in the funnel, it is vital that your sales team know who to chase and who not to.
Given the volume of leads that fill your funnel, sales teams have a hard time trying to convert leads into paying customers because they cannot differentiate between hot and cold.
This might result in leads dropping out from the funnel, or remaining stuck somewhere in the funnel eventually becoming cold leads, For an organization, this means losing out on money and business opportunities and that’s just one leak - there could be more leaks.
Make use of CRM funnel software to qualify leads, track them at every stage of their buyer’s journey, and follow up without any hassle on time.
Leveraging a CRM tool with sales funnel management capabilities positively impacts sales teams’ performance by leaps and bounds.
A sales CRM has more capabilities beyond just storing customer databases - it helps you define your sales process, identify possible cracks in the sales funnel, and streamline the conversion process to bring leads down to the bottom of the funnel.
KPIs and conversion rates are key aspects for sales teams to understand their sales funnel clearly.
Here are 3 key sales funnel metrics you should track -
This metric refers to the growth in your qualified leads, month on month - to measure how many leads you are currently working with are converting to customers.
This metric is a real-time indicator of growth and sales revenue.
Thus, a high lead velocity rate = high sales revenue.
With sales funnel software, you can create funnel reports to know how your leads are converting through different stages by sales reps. Analyzing which leads move down to the funnel and converting lets you plan better conversion strategies.
Always ensure not to rush their leads into the next stage of the process if the lead isn’t ready to move on.
Remember - no one likes an aggressive sales rep, and moving your lead along too quickly can backfire on you.
Keeping track of the time spent on each stage will allow you to shorten the sales cycle and create one that is effective and converts.
With your potential customer’s pain points and questions in mind, mapping out a sales funnel and implementing a start-to-finish sales funnel will make your team productive and efficient.
Remember, your work is not done when you create a sales funnel - this is where it all begins.
It is vital to measure your results - choose your KPIs, and then set up a measurement program. Take time to build out a sales funnel that actually works for you and addresses everything your audience wants.
Gather around data, analyze, and improve your sales funnel to get better results.
A good flow of people right from the top all the way to the action stage will ensure you have a successful business.

Have you ever wondered about your customer journey process and how they end up making a purchase from your organization?
A customer's journey is thoroughly mapped by a sales funnel, which outlines all the touchpoints your customers interact with your brand before they are ready to make a purchase.
Without solid sales funnel software, it is extremely tough to convert leads into paying customers and grow revenue over time.
So, where is the disconnect?
Answer - Lack of a functioning sales funnel!
To make a sale, you need to have a sales funnel in place and this is where an optimized sales funnel makes all the difference. Without one, your team might be riding high on the guesswork!
This article will cover the following -

An efficient CRM software can automate this whole process to simplify deal qualification in your organization.
Sales stages such as deals qualified, or appointments scheduled can be automated and keep other team members in the loop too.
Set up powerful workflows in your CRM software to fill gaps and speed up the process with automation rather than relying on manual power.
This stage of the sales funnel is extremely important. Once you move the lead further down the sales funnel, it is vital to create relevant opportunities by quantifying their value.
This is where you can leverage a sales CRM software - track and analyze each opportunity with maximum visibility.
Visual sales pipeline provides a quick overview of all stages of your sales funnel, allowing you to see how leads are moving throughout the funnel. It also provides sales reps with a quick estimate of their leads and urges them to add more leads.
Converting all leads that enter your sales funnel is a herculean task.
Not all leads are going to convert and it is a fact.
But with CRM software in place, when a potential sale falls through, all the information regarding the sale is available at fingertips - take a step back and assess what went wrong and what could have been done right.
An intuitive CRM software lets you identify the reason behind the loss and help you fill gaps in your existing sales funnel.
Create re-engagement campaigns in your CRM software and target your lost leads by providing value with an aha moment such as case studies, ebooks, webinars, and more.
The key is to make your leads feel that you were not there just to make that sale, but to nurture a relationship.
Lead nurturing is the process of actively engaging with leads via targeted campaigns. With CRM software, you can utilize tools designed especially for lead nurturing from the time they enter the sales funnel to when they make a purchase.
Your sales funnel is as effective as the work you put into it.
For a proper sales funnel to exist, you need to first identify your potential customers who can move through the funnel.
Here’s an example of how to create an ideal sales funnel for your business -
Identifying your ideal target audience is the most vital step in building an ideal sales funnel. If you do it right, you can figure -
The most important questions to ask your customers are -
Based on your data, you can create content for each stage of the funnel - ToFu, MoFu, and BoFu to help potential customers move down the funnel.
Without potential customers and people interested in your business, there is no sales funnel.
This means putting the right kind of content in front of your target audience.
Some of the most common ways to drive traffic to your business are -
Your paid ads and organic marketing need to take your prospects somewhere - this is where a landing page with a powerful CTA comes in.
If they click on an ad, sign up for your webinar, or even download a resource - they have to be redirected to a landing page.
Make sure to communicate who you are as a company and your unique benefits. Focus on capturing leads instead of making a sale.
In addition, ensure the landing page has a form to fill in their information for potential customers so you can communicate with them regarding your next step.
Now that you have captured the interest of your prospects, it is time to start a communication channel with them.
Market to your leads via email marketing by providing value and engaging content. Send updates regularly, but not too often.
At the end of your drip campaign, make an incredible offer that they cannot resist. That’s the piece of content that will push them into making a purchase.
Once your prospects turn into paying customers, do not forget about them.
Continue to reach out to them by sending useful, educational content. Thank them for their purchase and send them regular updates about any promotions or sales.
Involve them in your social media strategy and build a community for your customers to develop brand trust and loyalty.
The sales funnel essentially captures the movement of a lead through the sales process.
It’s not just a visual representation of the numbers in the form of a funnel, there’s more to it.
A sales funnel can help you analyze the number of leads who enter your funnel and the number who convert to customers and find a reason for a dip in these conversions.
While it’s impossible to convert every lead that comes in the funnel, it is vital that your sales team know who to chase and who not to.
Given the volume of leads that fill your funnel, sales teams have a hard time trying to convert leads into paying customers because they cannot differentiate between hot and cold.
This might result in leads dropping out from the funnel, or remaining stuck somewhere in the funnel eventually becoming cold leads, For an organization, this means losing out on money and business opportunities and that’s just one leak - there could be more leaks.
Make use of CRM funnel software to qualify leads, track them at every stage of their buyer’s journey, and follow up without any hassle on time.
Leveraging a CRM tool with sales funnel management capabilities positively impacts sales teams’ performance by leaps and bounds.
A sales CRM has more capabilities beyond just storing customer databases - it helps you define your sales process, identify possible cracks in the sales funnel, and streamline the conversion process to bring leads down to the bottom of the funnel.
KPIs and conversion rates are key aspects for sales teams to understand their sales funnel clearly.
Here are 3 key sales funnel metrics you should track -
This metric refers to the growth in your qualified leads, month on month - to measure how many leads you are currently working with are converting to customers.
This metric is a real-time indicator of growth and sales revenue.
Thus, a high lead velocity rate = high sales revenue.
With sales funnel software, you can create funnel reports to know how your leads are converting through different stages by sales reps. Analyzing which leads move down to the funnel and converting lets you plan better conversion strategies.
Always ensure not to rush their leads into the next stage of the process if the lead isn’t ready to move on.
Remember - no one likes an aggressive sales rep, and moving your lead along too quickly can backfire on you.
Keeping track of the time spent on each stage will allow you to shorten the sales cycle and create one that is effective and converts.
With your potential customer’s pain points and questions in mind, mapping out a sales funnel and implementing a start-to-finish sales funnel will make your team productive and efficient.
Remember, your work is not done when you create a sales funnel - this is where it all begins.
It is vital to measure your results - choose your KPIs, and then set up a measurement program. Take time to build out a sales funnel that actually works for you and addresses everything your audience wants.
Gather around data, analyze, and improve your sales funnel to get better results.
A good flow of people right from the top all the way to the action stage will ensure you have a successful business.

Even if you've never used CRM software before, you've probably heard the term bantered around in your industry.
Over the last few years, CRM software has evolved tremendously.
Regardless of the size of your business, you know how important customer relationships are to success. CRMs are powerful tools that facilitate your business growth while eliminating friction, automating administrative tasks, managing your deals, syncing data, and more.
But, what is a sales CRM, and what does it do? And more importantly, how can a CRM benefit your business?
In this guide, we'll cover -
CRM stands for customer relationship management, and it is a technology for managing and supporting customer relationships.
A sales CRM tool helps you engage with customers, including future customers, at every touchpoint throughout the sales process and maintain a positive customer relationship.
The CRM system streamlines every task of the entire sales pipeline and improves the overall customer journey with the aid of automation.
It helps teams across marketing, sales, customer support, commerce, and IT with the tools and information they need for personalized and enhanced customer experiences that drive actual business value.
In short, a CRM system helps businesses stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
The result: efficiency, better organization, improved time management, and happy clients.
A considerable amount of people think and confine the CRM platform's features to sales teams, given the fact that the end goal is to boost sales, but everyone in the organization can benefit from a CRM.
Short answer - anyone who runs a business can profit from a CRM platform.
A CRM tool helps you identify sales opportunities, manage sales and marketing campaigns, respond to service issues, store customer information, and maintain business relationships, all in one central location - and makes it easily available to anyone at your organization who might need it.
Businesses of all sizes use a CRM system - from mom-and-pop stores to small businesses, mid-size businesses, and even large corporates.
Everyone can benefit from better organization, centralized task management, and sophisticated AI and automation tools that help your team to work better and faster with less effort.
The effectiveness and importance of CRM can be implied by the fact that 91% of companies with more than 11 employees now use CRM software.
With easy visibility and access to data, the collaboration between teams to increase productivity has never been easier.
At its root, a sales CRM tool allows sales and marketing teams to manage, maintain, and analyze customer relationships and close deals.
A CRM extracts information from sources such as email, voice calls, sales tools, and other channels to help you attract more customers and retain the ones you have. It helps you to maintain and organize your workflow, sales funnel, and sales strategy so your team can collaborate, close more deals, and improve productivity.
In practice, a CRM should work the way your business works to make it seamless.
CRMs include a myriad of functionalities to help your team expedite business growth through various touchpoints, including -
CRM systems are generally designed to streamline and improve customer interactions by improving efficiencies across workflow and the sales funnel by automating tasks and analyzing data.
The best CRM software provides an all-in-one solution for managing your customer data, including voice, chat, and email touchpoints.
With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, your sales teams can save time and keep themselves from getting burnt out on cognitively distressing tasks.
Intuitive features such as click-to-call, automation, and cross-platform functionality make it a breeze to collaborate from anywhere, make your organization more agile, and save an incredible amount of revenue too.
CRMs, in addition to marketing automation, provide marketing teams and sales teams with a set of tools to manage their entire sales pipeline, marketing funnels, deal management, and more.
Here's a list of functionalities offered by a CRM -
Customer relationship management software or CRM solutions help organizations track, identify, analyze, manage, and interact with their customers.
The goal of having a CRM is to reach more prospects, accelerate conversion rates, maintain a high level of customer satisfaction, and overcome sales objections to make sure they come back for more.
There is a multitude of CRM solutions but they can be segmented into three primary types -
Operational CRMs help businesses streamline their business process to build better customer relationships.
Humans are not built to do repetitive tasks; they tend to make mistakes.
Operational CRMs provide tools to handle customer journeys more efficiently, even with a high number of touchpoints. The CRM tracks customer interactions right from the beginning throughout the whole lead management process as they move through the sales pipeline, and continues to analyze even after becoming a customer.
On the sales and marketing side of the team, operational CRM automates processes related to keeping tabs on customer data and customer satisfaction, forecasting the sales cycle, clerical tasks, and more, so they can focus on what actually matters.
Analytical CRMs go with the primary focus on helping you analyze customer data to gain actionable insights.
This type of sales CRM aggregates customer data from various sources to shadow patterns that are otherwise invisible to the human eye, usually slipping through the cracks.
The market is brimming with a ton of tools and technology to provide data, but the vital step required to turn that data into actionable insights is a difficult feat.
Reports suggest that over half of the data collected by companies never gets utilized.
An analytical sales CRM provides features that help you use the data to help you understand customer behavior. Using this information, your business can understand better how to mimic successful sales strategies, steps to increase customer retention, and what the most common problems are.
The primary focus of collaborative CRM systems is to break down silos.
Also called Strategic Sales CRM, this type of CRM centralizes customer data that can be easily accessible by the sales, customer support team, and marketing teams.
For bigger organizations, each department is separated based on factors such as geography, channels they serve, and products they sell. In order to provide a seamless customer experience throughout the sales process, you need a way to share important information in real-time.
Collaborative sales CRMs encompass two major elements: Interaction Management and Channel Management.
Interaction management keeps track of all customer interactions and channel management leverages the insights gained through interaction management to decide which channel to communicate with.
Since this data is shared across the organization, each department can act on it as and when required.
In addition, the seamless integration between all departments and channels saves customers from the dreaded experience of repeating themselves over and over again. Each employee can interact with the customer from the last point and easily pull up records of previous interactions to stay up to date.
A sales CRM plays an integral role in how each stage of your sales process functions.
With a sales CRM tool, your business can benefit in more than one way -
On a typical day, most sales reps spend a significant amount of time juggling everything from prospect research to cold calls to sending follow-up emails, manually.
On the other hand, sales managers keep themselves busy by monitoring their teams' performance and coaching team members that need extra assistance.
Without a centralized system, managing day-to-day operations can not only get extremely daunting but can quickly become dysfunctional in the respective department.
A sales CRM is designed to be a one-stop solution to simply everyday workflows.
These systems have the ability to integrate with your existing tools and communication channels, making it seamless to manage all tasks from a unified platform.
The CRM allows sales reps and team members from other departments to find the most accurate, up-to-date information in relation to the prospect to follow-up. Not just that, they can also engage with leads across all communication channels without having to switch tabs and lose data.
A sales CRM helps you identify and add new leads easily and even categorize them correctly.
Sales reps can prioritize opportunities that have a high tendency to convert, and marketing can identify leads that need more nurturing to become quality leads.
With accurate, centrally stored information about prospects and customer information, sales and marketing teams can focus their attention on the right clients.
For businesses that do not leverage a sales CRM, it is hard to analyze performance issues.
They have to compile massive amounts of data into spreadsheets, only leading to human errors and confusion.
With a sales CRM, analyzing and handling data becomes easy, since it does it for you. Customer information is automatically compiled into the system in real-time and provides insights into how well your sales department is functioning.
Some of the capabilities of a sales CRM are -
A sales funnel report can give an overall view of where and how the prospects are moving within the sales pipeline and provide insights into how deals are being won or lost.
A sales CRM can predict the expected closure of deals and revenue by analyzing the estimated close date, tendency to convert, and the likelihood of sales in your funnel.
These reports are to track your team’s progress towards revenue goals.
Sales managers can leverage these reports to assess how well individual sales reps are moving potential customers through the pipeline. They can also be used to view general conversion rates across your teams.
Get a complete breakdown of the activities being performed by your sales reps, including the number of calls made, emails sent, tasks completed, and more to keep track and improve their performance if needed.
These reports can be easily customized and filtered based on pipeline stages, individual sales rep’s performance, sales activities, and more.
Building a loyal customer base is all about building and maintaining healthy relationships.
A sales CRM automates repeated administrative tasks and data analysis tasks that typically eat up a sales rep’s time, so they can focus on other important tasks at hand.
Meaningful customer relationships can be established in less time, with more prospects in the sales pipeline, allowing sales reps to move through the pipeline quickly.
A sales CRM is a tool for managing all touchpoints of customers throughout the sales process, right from their first interaction till they drop off the website.
A touchpoint refers to any interaction - direct or indirect - between sales reps and their leads. The sales CRM tracks communication with prospects, automatically organizes customer data, sends reminders to follow up, and more.
A sales CRM is designed to simplify the process and also assist with lead nurturing.
With both administrative tasks and data operation being automated, your sales teams can spend less time on manual data entry and focus more on building meaningful relationships with prospects.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has proven, a business's ability to be responsive to external changes can make or break.
While some businesses have pivoted the change and been able to adapt their product to the change, some have collapsed.
So, what can a sales CRM do for your business?
Let’s look at how a robust system can ensure your business is ready for all storms and be at par with the age of the connected customer, who expects a consistently excellent user experience.
A unified sales CRM can connect various teams in your business such as sales, marketing, customer support, and product to create a holistic view of your sales pipeline and provide accurate information about your customers.
With 62% of customers prepared to share a bad experience with others, the benefits of ensuring an optimal customer journey cannot be understated.
A unified sales CRM will store all these interactions, across all devices and time zones to improve the overall customer experience.
With 64% of customers expecting personalized experiences, AI can collect data from past interactions to predict your customers’ behavior and provide the best-suited response.
Businesses can make smarter decisions with the help of artificial intelligence.
A sales CRM powered by artificial intelligence can track users across various channels and devices to assist sales reps with their decision-making process and focus better on leads that are more likely to convert.
In order to truly personalize the customer experience, businesses need to ensure that each interaction within their website is defined by the customer directly.
Hyper-personalization refers to customizing products based on the customer’s preferences, leveraging omnichannel data to personalize communication or even real-time engagement.
Creating hyper-personalized experiences for customers leads to an improved user experience, coupled with increased customer satisfaction with improved sales.
84% of customers claim that the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services.
Providing an enhanced customer experience and extended support is what drives retention.
Likewise, retention is inextricably linked to a company’s bottom line.
Keeping this in mind, 89% of customers are more loyal to companies they trust and 65% of them have stopped purchasing from companies that do not satisfy the quotas.
A sales CRM can supercharge the way your customer support and sales team function by keeping the customer at the center of all processes and improving customer retention drastically.
Any team that interacts with customers regularly within your organization can greatly benefit from using a sales CRM, including sales, marketing, and customer support teams.
A sales CRM software allows sales reps to manage their deals and conduct all their sales communications from a central location.
By integrating your sales CRM with existing business tools - including email, calendar, and social handles your sales reps do not have to waste time and effort switching back and forth between programs.
A sales CRM software also provides complete insights to the status of every deal in the progress, establish quotas, coach peers, and track individual sales reps’ performance.
Modern cloud-based CRM software can be accessed from anywhere, any time.
With the mobile CRM app, sales reps can access their dashboard and stay in the loop about any progress via mobile notifications so they do not miss anything important.
Ditch the guesswork and start making decisions powered by data to track deals.
The sales CRM analyzes a customer’s data patterns and interactions via sales reports. This can be leveraged by sales managers to determine what strategies are effective and which need to be improved.
A sales CRM helps you to track how potential customers find your business via online searches, paid marketing campaigns, or even industry-specific trade shows.
By having access to your company’s sales interactions, your marketing teams can better understand your prospects’ concerns and frequently asked questions and leverage this information to make better content.
Sales CRMs capture a wealth of valuable data that your marketing team can utilize to nurture prospects into customers and customers into loyal advocates.
Modern CRMs have the capability to integrate with a myriad of marketing tools so marketers can create effective email nurturing campaigns, forms, landing pages, ads, and more to keep potential customers moving steadily through the funnel.
Knowing the history of past customer interactions with your customers helps your customer support team to deliver excellent customer service every time.
By providing detailed customer notes and interactions, CRMs let your customer support reps build a personalized customer experience.
Faster response times for support tickets mean improved and more enjoyable customer satisfaction.
In addition, a sales CRM links important information - including products purchased, previous interactions, customer history, and more - to each support ticket so your sales reps can solve customers’ issues quickly and more effectively.
In addition to logging email conversations and phone calls, a sales CRM can be also integrated with online tools such as support-related channels so all customer chats are saved in your CRM.
Customer support teams can later review these saved chats in the future or send saved chat summaries to customers post the resolution.
A sales CRM is all about upping sales, saving time and money, and providing stellar customer service so they keep coming back for more.
To run a successful business, your sales process does not have to be complex, it’s all about how you handle it and how you can simplify the process.
A sales CRM is a tool that enables you to not just grow your revenue engine, but also grow your relationships with customers without a hassle.
Whatever the size of your business, a sales CRM tool exists to fit your needs.

Even if you've never used CRM software before, you've probably heard the term bantered around in your industry.
Over the last few years, CRM software has evolved tremendously.
Regardless of the size of your business, you know how important customer relationships are to success. CRMs are powerful tools that facilitate your business growth while eliminating friction, automating administrative tasks, managing your deals, syncing data, and more.
But, what is a sales CRM, and what does it do? And more importantly, how can a CRM benefit your business?
In this guide, we'll cover -
CRM stands for customer relationship management, and it is a technology for managing and supporting customer relationships.
A sales CRM tool helps you engage with customers, including future customers, at every touchpoint throughout the sales process and maintain a positive customer relationship.
The CRM system streamlines every task of the entire sales pipeline and improves the overall customer journey with the aid of automation.
It helps teams across marketing, sales, customer support, commerce, and IT with the tools and information they need for personalized and enhanced customer experiences that drive actual business value.
In short, a CRM system helps businesses stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
The result: efficiency, better organization, improved time management, and happy clients.
A considerable amount of people think and confine the CRM platform's features to sales teams, given the fact that the end goal is to boost sales, but everyone in the organization can benefit from a CRM.
Short answer - anyone who runs a business can profit from a CRM platform.
A CRM tool helps you identify sales opportunities, manage sales and marketing campaigns, respond to service issues, store customer information, and maintain business relationships, all in one central location - and makes it easily available to anyone at your organization who might need it.
Businesses of all sizes use a CRM system - from mom-and-pop stores to small businesses, mid-size businesses, and even large corporates.
Everyone can benefit from better organization, centralized task management, and sophisticated AI and automation tools that help your team to work better and faster with less effort.
The effectiveness and importance of CRM can be implied by the fact that 91% of companies with more than 11 employees now use CRM software.
With easy visibility and access to data, the collaboration between teams to increase productivity has never been easier.
At its root, a sales CRM tool allows sales and marketing teams to manage, maintain, and analyze customer relationships and close deals.
A CRM extracts information from sources such as email, voice calls, sales tools, and other channels to help you attract more customers and retain the ones you have. It helps you to maintain and organize your workflow, sales funnel, and sales strategy so your team can collaborate, close more deals, and improve productivity.
In practice, a CRM should work the way your business works to make it seamless.
CRMs include a myriad of functionalities to help your team expedite business growth through various touchpoints, including -
CRM systems are generally designed to streamline and improve customer interactions by improving efficiencies across workflow and the sales funnel by automating tasks and analyzing data.
The best CRM software provides an all-in-one solution for managing your customer data, including voice, chat, and email touchpoints.
With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, your sales teams can save time and keep themselves from getting burnt out on cognitively distressing tasks.
Intuitive features such as click-to-call, automation, and cross-platform functionality make it a breeze to collaborate from anywhere, make your organization more agile, and save an incredible amount of revenue too.
CRMs, in addition to marketing automation, provide marketing teams and sales teams with a set of tools to manage their entire sales pipeline, marketing funnels, deal management, and more.
Here's a list of functionalities offered by a CRM -
Customer relationship management software or CRM solutions help organizations track, identify, analyze, manage, and interact with their customers.
The goal of having a CRM is to reach more prospects, accelerate conversion rates, maintain a high level of customer satisfaction, and overcome sales objections to make sure they come back for more.
There is a multitude of CRM solutions but they can be segmented into three primary types -
Operational CRMs help businesses streamline their business process to build better customer relationships.
Humans are not built to do repetitive tasks; they tend to make mistakes.
Operational CRMs provide tools to handle customer journeys more efficiently, even with a high number of touchpoints. The CRM tracks customer interactions right from the beginning throughout the whole lead management process as they move through the sales pipeline, and continues to analyze even after becoming a customer.
On the sales and marketing side of the team, operational CRM automates processes related to keeping tabs on customer data and customer satisfaction, forecasting the sales cycle, clerical tasks, and more, so they can focus on what actually matters.
Analytical CRMs go with the primary focus on helping you analyze customer data to gain actionable insights.
This type of sales CRM aggregates customer data from various sources to shadow patterns that are otherwise invisible to the human eye, usually slipping through the cracks.
The market is brimming with a ton of tools and technology to provide data, but the vital step required to turn that data into actionable insights is a difficult feat.
Reports suggest that over half of the data collected by companies never gets utilized.
An analytical sales CRM provides features that help you use the data to help you understand customer behavior. Using this information, your business can understand better how to mimic successful sales strategies, steps to increase customer retention, and what the most common problems are.
The primary focus of collaborative CRM systems is to break down silos.
Also called Strategic Sales CRM, this type of CRM centralizes customer data that can be easily accessible by the sales, customer support team, and marketing teams.
For bigger organizations, each department is separated based on factors such as geography, channels they serve, and products they sell. In order to provide a seamless customer experience throughout the sales process, you need a way to share important information in real-time.
Collaborative sales CRMs encompass two major elements: Interaction Management and Channel Management.
Interaction management keeps track of all customer interactions and channel management leverages the insights gained through interaction management to decide which channel to communicate with.
Since this data is shared across the organization, each department can act on it as and when required.
In addition, the seamless integration between all departments and channels saves customers from the dreaded experience of repeating themselves over and over again. Each employee can interact with the customer from the last point and easily pull up records of previous interactions to stay up to date.
A sales CRM plays an integral role in how each stage of your sales process functions.
With a sales CRM tool, your business can benefit in more than one way -
On a typical day, most sales reps spend a significant amount of time juggling everything from prospect research to cold calls to sending follow-up emails, manually.
On the other hand, sales managers keep themselves busy by monitoring their teams' performance and coaching team members that need extra assistance.
Without a centralized system, managing day-to-day operations can not only get extremely daunting but can quickly become dysfunctional in the respective department.
A sales CRM is designed to be a one-stop solution to simply everyday workflows.
These systems have the ability to integrate with your existing tools and communication channels, making it seamless to manage all tasks from a unified platform.
The CRM allows sales reps and team members from other departments to find the most accurate, up-to-date information in relation to the prospect to follow-up. Not just that, they can also engage with leads across all communication channels without having to switch tabs and lose data.
A sales CRM helps you identify and add new leads easily and even categorize them correctly.
Sales reps can prioritize opportunities that have a high tendency to convert, and marketing can identify leads that need more nurturing to become quality leads.
With accurate, centrally stored information about prospects and customer information, sales and marketing teams can focus their attention on the right clients.
For businesses that do not leverage a sales CRM, it is hard to analyze performance issues.
They have to compile massive amounts of data into spreadsheets, only leading to human errors and confusion.
With a sales CRM, analyzing and handling data becomes easy, since it does it for you. Customer information is automatically compiled into the system in real-time and provides insights into how well your sales department is functioning.
Some of the capabilities of a sales CRM are -
A sales funnel report can give an overall view of where and how the prospects are moving within the sales pipeline and provide insights into how deals are being won or lost.
A sales CRM can predict the expected closure of deals and revenue by analyzing the estimated close date, tendency to convert, and the likelihood of sales in your funnel.
These reports are to track your team’s progress towards revenue goals.
Sales managers can leverage these reports to assess how well individual sales reps are moving potential customers through the pipeline. They can also be used to view general conversion rates across your teams.
Get a complete breakdown of the activities being performed by your sales reps, including the number of calls made, emails sent, tasks completed, and more to keep track and improve their performance if needed.
These reports can be easily customized and filtered based on pipeline stages, individual sales rep’s performance, sales activities, and more.
Building a loyal customer base is all about building and maintaining healthy relationships.
A sales CRM automates repeated administrative tasks and data analysis tasks that typically eat up a sales rep’s time, so they can focus on other important tasks at hand.
Meaningful customer relationships can be established in less time, with more prospects in the sales pipeline, allowing sales reps to move through the pipeline quickly.
A sales CRM is a tool for managing all touchpoints of customers throughout the sales process, right from their first interaction till they drop off the website.
A touchpoint refers to any interaction - direct or indirect - between sales reps and their leads. The sales CRM tracks communication with prospects, automatically organizes customer data, sends reminders to follow up, and more.
A sales CRM is designed to simplify the process and also assist with lead nurturing.
With both administrative tasks and data operation being automated, your sales teams can spend less time on manual data entry and focus more on building meaningful relationships with prospects.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has proven, a business's ability to be responsive to external changes can make or break.
While some businesses have pivoted the change and been able to adapt their product to the change, some have collapsed.
So, what can a sales CRM do for your business?
Let’s look at how a robust system can ensure your business is ready for all storms and be at par with the age of the connected customer, who expects a consistently excellent user experience.
A unified sales CRM can connect various teams in your business such as sales, marketing, customer support, and product to create a holistic view of your sales pipeline and provide accurate information about your customers.
With 62% of customers prepared to share a bad experience with others, the benefits of ensuring an optimal customer journey cannot be understated.
A unified sales CRM will store all these interactions, across all devices and time zones to improve the overall customer experience.
With 64% of customers expecting personalized experiences, AI can collect data from past interactions to predict your customers’ behavior and provide the best-suited response.
Businesses can make smarter decisions with the help of artificial intelligence.
A sales CRM powered by artificial intelligence can track users across various channels and devices to assist sales reps with their decision-making process and focus better on leads that are more likely to convert.
In order to truly personalize the customer experience, businesses need to ensure that each interaction within their website is defined by the customer directly.
Hyper-personalization refers to customizing products based on the customer’s preferences, leveraging omnichannel data to personalize communication or even real-time engagement.
Creating hyper-personalized experiences for customers leads to an improved user experience, coupled with increased customer satisfaction with improved sales.
84% of customers claim that the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services.
Providing an enhanced customer experience and extended support is what drives retention.
Likewise, retention is inextricably linked to a company’s bottom line.
Keeping this in mind, 89% of customers are more loyal to companies they trust and 65% of them have stopped purchasing from companies that do not satisfy the quotas.
A sales CRM can supercharge the way your customer support and sales team function by keeping the customer at the center of all processes and improving customer retention drastically.
Any team that interacts with customers regularly within your organization can greatly benefit from using a sales CRM, including sales, marketing, and customer support teams.
A sales CRM software allows sales reps to manage their deals and conduct all their sales communications from a central location.
By integrating your sales CRM with existing business tools - including email, calendar, and social handles your sales reps do not have to waste time and effort switching back and forth between programs.
A sales CRM software also provides complete insights to the status of every deal in the progress, establish quotas, coach peers, and track individual sales reps’ performance.
Modern cloud-based CRM software can be accessed from anywhere, any time.
With the mobile CRM app, sales reps can access their dashboard and stay in the loop about any progress via mobile notifications so they do not miss anything important.
Ditch the guesswork and start making decisions powered by data to track deals.
The sales CRM analyzes a customer’s data patterns and interactions via sales reports. This can be leveraged by sales managers to determine what strategies are effective and which need to be improved.
A sales CRM helps you to track how potential customers find your business via online searches, paid marketing campaigns, or even industry-specific trade shows.
By having access to your company’s sales interactions, your marketing teams can better understand your prospects’ concerns and frequently asked questions and leverage this information to make better content.
Sales CRMs capture a wealth of valuable data that your marketing team can utilize to nurture prospects into customers and customers into loyal advocates.
Modern CRMs have the capability to integrate with a myriad of marketing tools so marketers can create effective email nurturing campaigns, forms, landing pages, ads, and more to keep potential customers moving steadily through the funnel.
Knowing the history of past customer interactions with your customers helps your customer support team to deliver excellent customer service every time.
By providing detailed customer notes and interactions, CRMs let your customer support reps build a personalized customer experience.
Faster response times for support tickets mean improved and more enjoyable customer satisfaction.
In addition, a sales CRM links important information - including products purchased, previous interactions, customer history, and more - to each support ticket so your sales reps can solve customers’ issues quickly and more effectively.
In addition to logging email conversations and phone calls, a sales CRM can be also integrated with online tools such as support-related channels so all customer chats are saved in your CRM.
Customer support teams can later review these saved chats in the future or send saved chat summaries to customers post the resolution.
A sales CRM is all about upping sales, saving time and money, and providing stellar customer service so they keep coming back for more.
To run a successful business, your sales process does not have to be complex, it’s all about how you handle it and how you can simplify the process.
A sales CRM is a tool that enables you to not just grow your revenue engine, but also grow your relationships with customers without a hassle.
Whatever the size of your business, a sales CRM tool exists to fit your needs.

Businesses are all about creating and sustaining relationships, especially with customers more than it is about generating revenue.
The better your team nourishes its customer relationships, the faster is the organization's growth.
This is where a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) comes in handy. CRMs have become an indispensable part of high-functioning sales teams of all sizes.
So, why is CRM an indispensable tool in the sales tech stack?
Let's deep dive to find out more!
Customer relationship management or CRM is a technology that helps sales teams manage their customer relationships and interactions easily.
The goal of leveraging a CRM is simple: improve business relationships and close deals quickly.
CRMs help businesses stay up to date with their deal stages and stay connected with their customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization's individual relationship with people - including clients, vendors, suppliers, and more throughout the entire lifecycle.
A CRM system provides everyone, including sales reps, customer success teams, business development, or any other niche - an enhanced way to manage external relationships that drive actual success.
A CRM tool lets you store customer contact numbers, identify sales opportunities, sync data from third-party apps, record service requests, and more, all in a central storage system and make it easily accessible to anyone who might need it.
All businesses need a stellar strategy to keep the organization and revenue thriving. Hitting quarterly sales and revenue goals, tackling business objectives, and working towards profitability requires a strategy.
A CRM can help businesses have a clear overview of their customers. Sales reps can track all important sales data in a simple, customizable dashboard that can help you analyze data and have an overview of your sales pipeline.
Though CRM systems have been traditionally used by sales and marketing teams, customer service teams can highly benefit from the tool as well.
A CRM platform lets you manage, track, and analyze the entire sales cycle across various channels without losing track and gives sales, service, and marketing a single view of the pipeline.
Sales CRM is a tool that simplifies the process of qualifying leads, retrieves actionable data from sales calls, and ensures you do not miss following up on leads.
4 Reasons why organizations should adopt a CRM
Did you know that without CRM systems, 79% of all marketing leads are not converted to sales?
In addition, the lead management system benefits sales reps and sales managers to get a 360-degree view of all prospects in the sales pipeline.
With the aid of CRM software, salespeople can automatically capture leads from various sources and categorize them according to their characteristics such as location, buying behavior, and preferences.
This sales tool can help businesses determine which leads to focus on so salespeople do not waste their time chasing the wrong leads.
The sales analysis data also enables your team to track all prospects' interactions and arms your team with real-time data to make key decisions and move them down the sales funnel to boost sales.
For decades, salespeople have been asked to store all vital information regarding their customer communication on spreadsheets or in manually written notes. But, as the organization grows, pipelines and deals are meant to become larger and it becomes impossible for teams to maintain and track data on spreadsheets.
This is where CRMs can come in handy.
With CRMs, maintaining a comprehensive account history can be extremely helpful, especially when other team members are also involved to build solutions and brainstorming ideas for closing deals.
The system can also help manage workflows, set alerts, and receive intuitive signals to be sure of the next step with a prospect.
In today's world, customer satisfaction is a key component of your brand.
Customer satisfaction can make or break your reputation in the business world. Studies show that organizations with efficient customer service tend to attract more clients and make more sales.
CRMs can be used to provide improved customer service by enabling your sales reps to stay in touch with their customers regularly. In addition, it allows you to collect customers' data based on their past interactions on your website.
CRMs leverage artificial intelligence to improve the customer's experience. The collected customer data creates a base for providing improved customer service and makes them want to come back.
Not just that, a CRM helps you deliver quick responses in human-like language to mimic a sales rep to customer queries for a greater customer experience.
Data related to sales activities like social media posts, product reviews, customer communication, and transactions - it's everywhere!
However, accumulating raw data without any actionable insights is of no use if it is not organized and structured correctly.
With CRMs having wide capabilities such as robust reporting and analytics can help you to dive deep into your sales pipeline and help you improve performance to meet sales goals.
CRM dashboards can help you gain important insights and understand vital metrics to make proactive decisions, respond to changes in the external environment, and achieve revenue goals.
Some of the most useful functions of a CRM tool that can guide sales managers to gain a deeper understanding of their potential customers are:
Sales reps can make and receive calls from the web and mobile CRM app, keep track of multiple sales pipelines at once, sales activities, and more to never miss an opportunity to reach out to potential customers.
While business intelligence features are extremely helpful for sales teams, not every information received is relevant to sales reps.
Sales reps need to focus on various key features - contact management, lead and pipeline tracking, seamless customer communication, and deal management.
Here's how your sales team can pick the best CRM software -
One of the primary challenges for most businesses before embracing a CRM is user adoption.
The expectations from CRMs are changing, and with the consumer behavior changing rapidly in these modern times, choosing a CRM that caters to their needs is vital.
A CRM software should be easy to use, intuitive in nature, straightforward to integrate, and be a breeze, so salespeople can quickly adapt.
Tip - Before choosing a CRM, make sure the implementation process is quick and easy. Be sure to pick a CRM which provides a freemium, or a free trial to understand and experience the software first-hand.
The goal of leveraging a CRM in addition to improving productivity is its integration capabilities.
An organization employing a modern CRM solution must cater to their needs and requirements without a hassle, including easy integration to their existing software and avoiding manual data importing.
The ease at which you can export your important files and information regarding sales activities carries high importance.
Tip - Reach out to the customer service team prior to purchasing the software and get a list of tools and software their CRM can integrate with.
Pick a solution that aligns with the medium to the long-term vision of your organization. There is no point in picking a solution that is lower priced and with limited features, and you outgrow them within a short span of time. The time it takes to migrate and change your process would negate any savings made from picking a lower-priced solution.
Also, if you pick the solution with the maximum features, and higher price, you may end up paying for features that you don’t need or use in the medium term.
Striking a perfect balance and picking a solution that can grow along with your organization’s long-term plans is important to ensure the viability of the solution adopted.
Tip - Take into account the medium to long-term needs of all the teams(sales, marketing, customer support) who will be using the CRM, and pick a solution that aligns with all their needs.
Apart from this, it is also important to pick a vendor that offers good customer support.
And depending on your requirements, you need to decide if you want an on-premise or cloud service.
A simpler way to decide would be to research the solutions that your competitors and other players in the industry use, and adopt similar solutions to ensure maximum efficiency.
Here's how Salesken can guide your sales reps and sales team with their everyday sales activities to improve their sales performance and close more deals -
Salesken leverages the latest conversation intelligence capabilities to provide real-time assistance to reps.

With a myriad of CRM for sales reps in the market, it can get daunting to select the right CRM for your sales teams and want to try every single software.
Every CRM software in the market offers its own set of modules and features, but these factors outweigh when sales teams have to choose the features that are the most relevant to them.
Consider key factors vital to your decision-making process to choose the best CRM for sales in the market to get a better idea of how these platforms perform as opposed to others in the ecosystem.
What features and modules are the most important to your sales team and how do they impact your decision-making process? Let us know in the comments!
If you're looking to switch to a sales intelligent tool like Salesken to help your sales team ease their sales process, stay on top of their sales activities, and close deals, book a demo with our expert now.
The future of a CRM lies in advanced artificial intelligence and mobility, especially with the recent urge for remote communications. Experts in the B2B field predict the future will pave way for digital strategies and customer-focused initiatives.
The latest technology in CRMs is artificial intelligence and AI-powered customer support. Several tools in the market are already pioneering in this technology to provide the best sales intelligence to their customers. Artificial intelligence has a spectrum of technologies including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and predictive analytics.
Picking an established player means that you know what you get, and there is predictability in their offerings. But, they may not be able to offer to customize their solutions to your needs and can be higher priced as well.
And new vendors, while offering customization, personalized experience, and being lower-priced, may not necessarily be able to meet all your requirements immediately.
Before deciding on the vendor, consider the needs of all your users, and your long-term goals, and choose the solution that aligns with the needs and requirements of all the key stakeholders.

Businesses are all about creating and sustaining relationships, especially with customers more than it is about generating revenue.
The better your team nourishes its customer relationships, the faster is the organization's growth.
This is where a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) comes in handy. CRMs have become an indispensable part of high-functioning sales teams of all sizes.
So, why is CRM an indispensable tool in the sales tech stack?
Let's deep dive to find out more!
Customer relationship management or CRM is a technology that helps sales teams manage their customer relationships and interactions easily.
The goal of leveraging a CRM is simple: improve business relationships and close deals quickly.
CRMs help businesses stay up to date with their deal stages and stay connected with their customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization's individual relationship with people - including clients, vendors, suppliers, and more throughout the entire lifecycle.
A CRM system provides everyone, including sales reps, customer success teams, business development, or any other niche - an enhanced way to manage external relationships that drive actual success.
A CRM tool lets you store customer contact numbers, identify sales opportunities, sync data from third-party apps, record service requests, and more, all in a central storage system and make it easily accessible to anyone who might need it.
All businesses need a stellar strategy to keep the organization and revenue thriving. Hitting quarterly sales and revenue goals, tackling business objectives, and working towards profitability requires a strategy.
A CRM can help businesses have a clear overview of their customers. Sales reps can track all important sales data in a simple, customizable dashboard that can help you analyze data and have an overview of your sales pipeline.
Though CRM systems have been traditionally used by sales and marketing teams, customer service teams can highly benefit from the tool as well.
A CRM platform lets you manage, track, and analyze the entire sales cycle across various channels without losing track and gives sales, service, and marketing a single view of the pipeline.
Sales CRM is a tool that simplifies the process of qualifying leads, retrieves actionable data from sales calls, and ensures you do not miss following up on leads.
4 Reasons why organizations should adopt a CRM
Did you know that without CRM systems, 79% of all marketing leads are not converted to sales?
In addition, the lead management system benefits sales reps and sales managers to get a 360-degree view of all prospects in the sales pipeline.
With the aid of CRM software, salespeople can automatically capture leads from various sources and categorize them according to their characteristics such as location, buying behavior, and preferences.
This sales tool can help businesses determine which leads to focus on so salespeople do not waste their time chasing the wrong leads.
The sales analysis data also enables your team to track all prospects' interactions and arms your team with real-time data to make key decisions and move them down the sales funnel to boost sales.
For decades, salespeople have been asked to store all vital information regarding their customer communication on spreadsheets or in manually written notes. But, as the organization grows, pipelines and deals are meant to become larger and it becomes impossible for teams to maintain and track data on spreadsheets.
This is where CRMs can come in handy.
With CRMs, maintaining a comprehensive account history can be extremely helpful, especially when other team members are also involved to build solutions and brainstorming ideas for closing deals.
The system can also help manage workflows, set alerts, and receive intuitive signals to be sure of the next step with a prospect.
In today's world, customer satisfaction is a key component of your brand.
Customer satisfaction can make or break your reputation in the business world. Studies show that organizations with efficient customer service tend to attract more clients and make more sales.
CRMs can be used to provide improved customer service by enabling your sales reps to stay in touch with their customers regularly. In addition, it allows you to collect customers' data based on their past interactions on your website.
CRMs leverage artificial intelligence to improve the customer's experience. The collected customer data creates a base for providing improved customer service and makes them want to come back.
Not just that, a CRM helps you deliver quick responses in human-like language to mimic a sales rep to customer queries for a greater customer experience.
Data related to sales activities like social media posts, product reviews, customer communication, and transactions - it's everywhere!
However, accumulating raw data without any actionable insights is of no use if it is not organized and structured correctly.
With CRMs having wide capabilities such as robust reporting and analytics can help you to dive deep into your sales pipeline and help you improve performance to meet sales goals.
CRM dashboards can help you gain important insights and understand vital metrics to make proactive decisions, respond to changes in the external environment, and achieve revenue goals.
Some of the most useful functions of a CRM tool that can guide sales managers to gain a deeper understanding of their potential customers are:
Sales reps can make and receive calls from the web and mobile CRM app, keep track of multiple sales pipelines at once, sales activities, and more to never miss an opportunity to reach out to potential customers.
While business intelligence features are extremely helpful for sales teams, not every information received is relevant to sales reps.
Sales reps need to focus on various key features - contact management, lead and pipeline tracking, seamless customer communication, and deal management.
Here's how your sales team can pick the best CRM software -
One of the primary challenges for most businesses before embracing a CRM is user adoption.
The expectations from CRMs are changing, and with the consumer behavior changing rapidly in these modern times, choosing a CRM that caters to their needs is vital.
A CRM software should be easy to use, intuitive in nature, straightforward to integrate, and be a breeze, so salespeople can quickly adapt.
Tip - Before choosing a CRM, make sure the implementation process is quick and easy. Be sure to pick a CRM which provides a freemium, or a free trial to understand and experience the software first-hand.
The goal of leveraging a CRM in addition to improving productivity is its integration capabilities.
An organization employing a modern CRM solution must cater to their needs and requirements without a hassle, including easy integration to their existing software and avoiding manual data importing.
The ease at which you can export your important files and information regarding sales activities carries high importance.
Tip - Reach out to the customer service team prior to purchasing the software and get a list of tools and software their CRM can integrate with.
Pick a solution that aligns with the medium to the long-term vision of your organization. There is no point in picking a solution that is lower priced and with limited features, and you outgrow them within a short span of time. The time it takes to migrate and change your process would negate any savings made from picking a lower-priced solution.
Also, if you pick the solution with the maximum features, and higher price, you may end up paying for features that you don’t need or use in the medium term.
Striking a perfect balance and picking a solution that can grow along with your organization’s long-term plans is important to ensure the viability of the solution adopted.
Tip - Take into account the medium to long-term needs of all the teams(sales, marketing, customer support) who will be using the CRM, and pick a solution that aligns with all their needs.
Apart from this, it is also important to pick a vendor that offers good customer support.
And depending on your requirements, you need to decide if you want an on-premise or cloud service.
A simpler way to decide would be to research the solutions that your competitors and other players in the industry use, and adopt similar solutions to ensure maximum efficiency.
Here's how Salesken can guide your sales reps and sales team with their everyday sales activities to improve their sales performance and close more deals -
Salesken leverages the latest conversation intelligence capabilities to provide real-time assistance to reps. The reps can know how top reps handle difficult customers and adopt successful behaviors to win more deals. Salesken’s state-of-the-art emotion detection can help detect the prospect’s mood, and the reps can tailor the pitch accordingly.

An intuitive sales tool such as Salesken can easily automate all your sales-related data with easy workflows.
Right from sending a follow-up email, onboarding process, sales activities such as welcome messages, respond to frequently asked questions - sales CRM does it all.
Salesken automates all mundane tasks performed by sales reps on a daily basis and simplifies the sales process so your team can spend time focusing on making more sales.
Salesken allows you to easily track warm deals, analyze sales pipeline data, and organize your sales pipeline.
The sales representative can automate, track, and streamline their sales activities in a unified platform such as Salesken resulting in high productivity.
Not just that, your sales team can also automate sales assignments by setting easy workflows and tracking them using our reports via Salesken's mobile app.
Gauge which deal has a better chance of closing vs which deal needs more attention by leveraging our easy analysis reports, and sentiment analysis to help you understand the tendency to convert and provide necessary collateral to close the deal.
Salesken's easy integration option with third-party apps such as Salesforce, Twilio, Pipedrive, and more is a testament to how businesses of all sizes can thrive in their respective sectors.
Integrate your favorite tool with Salesken without any interference with outside members, or technical support so you never lose data and do not lose focus on your deal pipeline.
Say goodbye to manual data feed with Salesken's easy integration.
With a myriad of CRM for sales reps in the market, it can get daunting to select the right CRM for your sales teams and want to try every single software.
Every CRM software in the market offers its own set of modules and features, but these factors outweigh when sales teams have to choose the features that are the most relevant to them.
Consider key factors vital to your decision-making process to choose the best CRM for sales in the market to get a better idea of how these platforms perform as opposed to others in the ecosystem.
What features and modules are the most important to your sales team and how do they impact your decision-making process? Let us know in the comments!
If you're looking to switch to a sales intelligent tool like Salesken to help your sales team ease their sales process, stay on top of their sales activities, and close deals, book a demo with our expert now.
The future of a CRM lies in advanced artificial intelligence and mobility, especially with the recent urge for remote communications. Experts in the B2B field predict the future will pave way for digital strategies and customer-focused initiatives.
The latest technology in CRMs is artificial intelligence and AI-powered customer support. Several tools in the market are already pioneering in this technology to provide the best sales intelligence to their customers. Artificial intelligence has a spectrum of technologies including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and predictive analytics.
Picking an established player means that you know what you get, and there is predictability in their offerings. But, they may not be able to offer to customize their solutions to your needs and can be higher priced as well.
And new vendors, while offering customization, personalized experience, and being lower-priced, may not necessarily be able to meet all your requirements immediately.
Before deciding on the vendor, consider the needs of all your users, and your long-term goals, and choose the solution that aligns with the needs and requirements of all the key stakeholders.

The COVID 19 crisis has dramatically changed the Sales profession. Face-To-Face sales meetings have become impossible and Inside Sales, which was around 40% of the sales volume in January 2020, has now become the dominant mode of selling. With this paradigm shift, organizations are adopting tools that will enable their sales teams to continue selling.
Our goal at Salesken is to use the Science of Sales to make every sales rep a top performer. We assist and analyze customer conversations and provide insights to help sales teams close more deals.
Most popular Sales Enablement Tools require desktops or laptops, a high-speed internet connection and in some cases a desk phone. With sudden closure of offices, which looks to extend late into this year, many sales teams could not provision this infrastructure to their reps. The problem is compounded in developing countries like India where internet connections are slow, a new laptop often costs as high as 200% of a sales reps' salary - mobile phones have become the de-facto mode of communication and work.
Even before the COVID 19 crisis struck, we had realized the need to develop a mobile application. Sales teams wanted the flexibility to interact with the customers without having to be tied down to their office desks. The lockdowns and disruption they caused, accelerated its demand. However, we too had to move a growing team to remote work on a week's notice. And launching an app, while all of us weren’t under the same roof, brought with it, a new set of challenges. Ideations, Designing, Testing, and other processes had to be done while all were working remotely.
Though challenging at the beginning, with time, by adhering to some remote collaboration techniques, we got better. Read here.
The technical challenge was, we not only had to record and transcribe these mobile calls but also analyse the data generated in order to enable our cues in real time. With slow and unreliable internet connections, the audio quality was often poor. We had to redesign our ASR and Analytics Engine to enable real-time cueing. Adapting our software to these constraints has been a huge learning and a humbling experience.

We are proud to announce the launch of Salesken Mobile App. You can now call your prospects (through VoIP or mobile networks), schedule follow-ups and next stage activities, send messages, create new leads, and more, from your Android or iOS devices. Real-time cueing is also enabled to help reps close more deals and make every conversation count.
Having an app also helped our own sales team adapt to selling amidst the lockdown and pandemic!
In the next version, we will look to provide micro reports in real-time. This will show the sales reps what went right, and where they need to improve while interacting with the prospects. Also, we want to enable video calls on our mobile apps to ensure all customer interactions can be done over Salesken’s Mobile Application itself.
As organizations shift to remote sales, we are hopeful, that Salesken’s Mobile App will enable teams to adapt better. Salesken App is available on both Android Playstore and Apple App Store. Do check it out and give us your feedback. We would love to hear from you!

#1 Sales Automation Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.










Reason #1:
Sales leaders can not only track won-lost deals, and gauge what worked, but gather deep, actionable insights from all sales activities to find the right coaching opportunities. With Salesken's sales automation software, as a sales leader, you have deal risk alerts delivered to you at the right time along with recommendations to fix the deals at risk. Sales automation takes care of it all–tracks every interaction and picks up exactly where your sales reps left off, missed steps, or customer service issues falling through the cracks.
Reason #2:
Sales force automation software empowers sales reps to collaborate more effectively. It's one of the most effective ways to boost your sales and marketing outreach. With Salesken, you can grow your pipeline by up to 20%. Streamline communication and eliminate time-wasting tasks with automated workflows and reminders, push notifications delivered directly to your inboxes. Keep up to speed on key developments in the sales process with automated push notifications and take control of both unstructured and structured data, simplifying for managers and reps alike.
Reason #3:
Reason #4:
Sales reps are the lifeblood of your organization. They're on the phone, in meetings, and on the road every day. But when they're bogged down with tedious tasks like sending follow-up emails and making follow-up calls, they can't spend as much time selling. With sales automation software, you can take the burden off your reps so they can focus on what they do best—selling. It's an unfair advantage to give them back their time and make them more productive. Salesken helps you put together a higher-performing team without adding any costs, and improves the overall sales productivity of your team!
Reason #5:
Sales teams spend hours on the phone with prospects who don't qualify for the products or services being sold. Salesken's sales automation allows you to filter out those who don't qualify and lets you prioritise the leads of high quality. Your sales team can focus on prospects that are more likely to buy. Not just that, sales automation helps you close more deals and keep your sales team from wasting time with unqualified leads. It's an affordable and easy-to-use system that will help you close more deals and increase revenue.
Reason #6:
Sales reporting can be complex–understanding the right sales insights and tracking the correct metrics can be daunting and extremely confusing. But when automated, reports and insights are dissected from bottom to top, with the window to comment on specific sections in real time with the help of our customer relationship management software. Say goodbye to creating manual reports and saving time, thus helping you to close more deals.

#1 Sales Automation Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.










Reason #1:
Sales leaders can not only track won-lost deals, and gauge what worked, but gather deep, actionable insights from all sales activities to find the right coaching opportunities. With Salesken's sales automation software, as a sales leader, you have deal risk alerts delivered to you at the right time along with recommendations to fix the deals at risk. Sales automation takes care of it all–tracks every interaction and picks up exactly where your sales reps left off, missed steps, or customer service issues falling through the cracks.
Reason #2:
Sales force automation software empowers sales reps to collaborate more effectively. It's one of the most effective ways to boost your sales and marketing outreach. With Salesken, you can grow your pipeline by up to 20%. Streamline communication and eliminate time-wasting tasks with automated workflows and reminders, push notifications delivered directly to your inboxes. Keep up to speed on key developments in the sales process with automated push notifications and take control of both unstructured and structured data, simplifying for managers and reps alike.
Reason #3:
Reason #4:
Sales reps are the lifeblood of your organization. They're on the phone, in meetings, and on the road every day. But when they're bogged down with tedious tasks like sending follow-up emails and making follow-up calls, they can't spend as much time selling. With sales automation software, you can take the burden off your reps so they can focus on what they do best—selling. It's an unfair advantage to give them back their time and make them more productive. Salesken helps you put together a higher-performing team without adding any costs, and improves the overall sales productivity of your team!
Reason #5:
Sales teams spend hours on the phone with prospects who don't qualify for the products or services being sold. Salesken's sales automation allows you to filter out those who don't qualify and lets you prioritise the leads of high quality. Your sales team can focus on prospects that are more likely to buy. Not just that, sales automation helps you close more deals and keep your sales team from wasting time with unqualified leads. It's an affordable and easy-to-use system that will help you close more deals and increase revenue.
Reason #6:
Sales reporting can be complex–understanding the right sales insights and tracking the correct metrics can be daunting and extremely confusing. But when automated, reports and insights are dissected from bottom to top, with the window to comment on specific sections in real time with the help of our customer relationship management software. Say goodbye to creating manual reports and saving time, thus helping you to close more deals.

Business-to-Business (B2B) sales have come a long way. It is no longer about pushing the customers to purchase a product. B2B sales is all about building and nurturing relationships with prospects, understanding their needs, and adding value through a relevant solution.
The B2B sales industry has a lot of opportunities.
However, this also means that the competition in this industry will also increase in the coming years.
So what is the way out?
To begin with, B2B sales teams should follow a strong sales strategy framework that generates and converts leads seamlessly. In this comprehensive guide, we will let you know the steps to create such a sales strategy plan from scratch.
A sales strategy framework is the cornerstone of your entire sales process. From defining target buyer profiles to converting leads, a sales strategy includes all critical details in a single place.
Here is the step-by-step plan to build your sales strategy framework:
A B2B business cannot sell to everyone. It is a common misconception that a larger customer base is synonymous with high revenue. In fact, B2B businesses should invest more in customizing their products to make them suitable for their target audiences.
The question that pertains here is, how can you customize your product for the target audiences? And the answer would be by creating dedicated ICPs for different customer segments.
You can start creating your ICP by asking the answers to following questions:
Finding the answers to these questions can help your sales team in the long run. It will ensure that they have a clear idea about the prospects and there is no room for assumption. With a specific ICP, sales teams can:
Once you successfully define your ICP, the next step is to conduct in-depth research in the target market for a clear understanding of the competitors’ strategies. This will help you identify the gap and develop a unique USP.
Some of the key questions to get started with competitor research are:
The answers to these questions will help you gain better insights into the market. The sales reps will use these datasets to figure out the gaps in the target industry and accordingly they will develop their sales strategy.
The next step is to identify a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) based on the target market and competitor information. It is one of the most critical steps as a value proposition or USP can make or break your sales strategy.
An ideal USP should answer one question - why should the prospects invest in your solution when there are some existing competitors/alternatives in the market?
To find an answer to this question, you need to address the following aspects:
Your USP should be a combination of all these factors that specifically highlights why prospects must invest in your product.

See how Slack has summed up the value proposition in a brief yet specific way. With a single glance, you will know what Slack does and who should use this tool.
The value proposition should be crafted in a way that leaves no room for confusion.
The integral part of any sales strategy is the sales process. Sales teams should document the steps that the sales reps will follow to convert a lead into a customer.
A common B2B sales process is:
However, it may vary based on the organization and its target market.
Here’s a blog that explains the concept of B2B sales process and the steps of the B2B sales cycle in an in-depth manner - B2B Sales Cycle - Length, Stages & Process - A comprehensive Guide for Sales Teams in 2022
Converting leads into customers is the ultimate goal of any sales strategy. Mapping the lead conversion process can help the sales teams to repurpose the same template as per their requirements.
The customer conversion map must include the following aspects:
For each problem identified by a business, it is the sales reps’ responsibility to navigate the prospects toward the solutions. The possible steps in this process can be:
The purpose of mapping your customer conversion process is to ensure that at each stage of the buyer journey, customer pain points are addressed.
A major step in forming a sales strategy is to plan a consistent sales coaching and training process. Regular training and upskilling are essential for the sales reps to stay updated about changing industry trends. Such training can help them know what's working and what’s not so that they can personalize their sales approach.
This is true for experienced sales reps as well as new sales reps.
What is better than a regular sales coaching program?
A data-driven, automated, real-time coaching program where the sales reps can get 1:1 assistance and improve their sales approach.
It is possible with Salesken. Salesken’s sales coaching software helps sales reps to:
Now that you know what to do while building a sales strategy framework, you must also know what NOT to do. Here are a few mistakes that sales reps often make while developing their sales strategy:
Every organization should have a different vision that matches its own value proposition and target prospects. Even though two organizations are operating in the same industry, it is unlikely that their visions will be similar.
Startups often make the mistake of imitating their competitors’ vision while starting. It can not lead businesses to long-term success. Ideally, refining a competitor’s vision should be done and personalizing it based on your brand positioning.
Clearly, sales-y USPs and pitches won’t help here. For B2B audiences, reps should rather focus on crafting unique USPs that match their requirements and that show how you can solve their challenges.
B2B decision-makers don’t like to feel that something is being “sold” to them. Rather, they prefer selecting a product that adds maximum value.
B2B sales reps should prioritize prospects’ emotions and needs over everything. The sales calls should be more about how reps can help the prospect and less about how good a product is.
A large part of buyer decision-making is based on the emotional aspects. If the prospects feel that your product can solve their problem, they will consider buying it. It is all about winning their trust and navigating through their needs.
Sales and marketing teams go hand-in-hand. Hence, both teams should communicate the same brand messaging to the prospects. The marketing team is responsible for creating content for different channels of an organization and content plays a key role in brand communication.
When your marketing and sales teams scream the same brand message, it becomes clearer for audiences to develop trust.
A sales strategy framework helps businesses to streamline their sales operations and strengthen their lead generation game. The steps mentioned here can help new sales reps to get started with building their sales plan.
It is common to face some challenges in the process but the long-term gains of developing a sales strategy are exceptional. B2B prospects are consistently self-educating themselves and a definitive sales strategy can ensure that you get noticed in this highly competitive world of B2B sales.

#1 Sales Operations Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Reason #1:
Sales operation software accurately collects data, including both internal performance data and external market conditions, and analyzes them to determine the effectiveness of a product or a sales procedure. It helps your sales manager identify whether the product or service is a success or whether they need to implement a new sales framework.
Reason #2:
With the help of sales operation software, you can understand your past and current data along with market trends and accurately forecast future sales. Sales forecasting is essential as it helps you identify potential risks ahead of time and help fix them so that reps can achieve their goals and improve their overall performance. Besides, it gives a clear understanding of the company's future revenue and financial strength.
Reason #3:
Call quality monitoring process has traditionally been a manual process in the majority of the organizations. It has proven to be ineffective as it involves Sales managers listening and analyzing sales conversations during their productive work hours. An operations software in sales automatically records and scores these conversations across different playbook dimensions and selling best practices so that the managers can take necessary action saving their valuable time spent on manual QA.
Reason #4:
Another benefit of having a sales operation management platform is that it establishes a single line of communication. Sales reps can update their sales performance, and the entire team members stay updated about the latest sales activity. In other words, it keeps the team aligned by providing a single platform for all communication within the organization.
Reason #5:
Sales operation software collects all data, analyzes them, and helps provide training materials for the reps. Besides, it stores all information on a single platform, ensuring a smooth experience for your new recruits. With the help of the solution, you can develop an intelligent sales training program and maintain a strong team.
Reason #6:
Sales operation software takes care of administrative tasks like lead generation, scheduling appointments, sending reminders for follow-up calls, and more. This allows your reps to focus on selling. Further, it assists in qualifying marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to sales qualified leads (SQLs) based on the ways the leads communicate and track their other activities.

#1 Sales Operations Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Reason #1:
Sales operation software accurately collects data, including both internal performance data and external market conditions, and analyzes them to determine the effectiveness of a product or a sales procedure. It helps your sales manager identify whether the product or service is a success or whether they need to implement a new sales framework.
Reason #2:
With the help of sales operation software, you can understand your past and current data along with market trends and accurately forecast future sales. Sales forecasting is essential as it helps you identify potential risks ahead of time and help fix them so that reps can achieve their goals and improve their overall performance. Besides, it gives a clear understanding of the company's future revenue and financial strength.
Reason #3:
Call quality monitoring process has traditionally been a manual process in the majority of the organizations. It has proven to be ineffective as it involves Sales managers listening and analyzing sales conversations during their productive work hours. An operations software in sales automatically records and scores these conversations across different playbook dimensions and selling best practices so that the managers can take necessary action saving their valuable time spent on manual QA.
Reason #4:
Another benefit of having a sales operation management platform is that it establishes a single line of communication. Sales reps can update their sales performance, and the entire team members stay updated about the latest sales activity. In other words, it keeps the team aligned by providing a single platform for all communication within the organization.
Reason #5:
Sales operation software collects all data, analyzes them, and helps provide training materials for the reps. Besides, it stores all information on a single platform, ensuring a smooth experience for your new recruits. With the help of the solution, you can develop an intelligent sales training program and maintain a strong team.
Reason #6:
Sales operation software takes care of administrative tasks like lead generation, scheduling appointments, sending reminders for follow-up calls, and more. This allows your reps to focus on selling. Further, it assists in qualifying marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to sales qualified leads (SQLs) based on the ways the leads communicate and track their other activities.

Sales professionals have the superpower to sell anything and everything!
While this is true, it is also true that some sales strategies don’t work every time. The product and target customers should ultimately define your sales strategy. Developing a software sales strategy has its fair share of challenges.
Unlike hardware sales, where the sales reps need to sell physical products, software sales reps need to master the art of selling digital products. As a result, software sales cycles are longer and involve multiple stakeholders.
On average, a Business-to-Business (B2B) software sales cycle is 84 days long. Clearly, sales reps require a lot of patience and an innovative sales strategy to sell software solutions.
This guide explains some stellar B2B sales strategies to sell software effectively.
Selling hardware is completely different from selling software. Hardware products are tangible, so potential customers can see and touch them before making their ultimate purchase decision.
However, software solutions require a completely new approach because they are available digitally. Therefore, the focus of sales reps selling software solutions remains on winning prospects’ trust by offering them a solution to their pain points.
Here are a few aspects that make a software sales strategy unique from a hardware sales strategy:
Product marketing is the cornerstone of software selling. In B2B organizations, product marketers are responsible for a lot of product-related decision-making, starting from research, creating roadmaps, collecting customers’ feedback, communicating with the development teams, and so on.
When it comes to selling software, product marketers can be of great help to the sales reps. Sales reps can collect relevant materials and resources to understand each software in depth. Accordingly, they can explain the solutions during sales calls to win over prospects’ trust.
With assistance from the product marketing team, sales teams can figure out a strategic way to share information about the software they are selling. Sales reps can understand which software benefits should be included within their sales decks to persuade the prospects.
Adding product managers during product demo sessions is also a proven method of success in B2B software sales.
A hardware or a physical product doesn’t change or upgrade too frequently. Think about mobile, laptops, wearable devices, etc. On average, a new series is introduced for these products at least once a year. Hence, the sales reps have a whole year to learn about the new products.
The scenario is totally different in the case of the B2B software industry. Software solutions require upgrades very frequently. It could be months, weeks, or even days. Therefore, the software sales reps need to learn about these updates thoroughly to explain them to the prospects.
The sales and marketing teams should have a consistent workflow of collaboration with product teams. That way, whenever there is a new software update, the marketing and sales teams should get a quick notification to start learning more about it.
B2B software sales cycles are longer, irrespective of the price of a software. Largely because of multiple digital touchpoints and multiple decision-makers involved in the sales process. Hence, pushing the prospects directly to boost sales doesn’t work here.
Instead, B2B sales reps should have sufficient content available to build and nurture relationships with the prospects and slowly navigate them throughout the sales cycle. Nudging them to purchase won’t make a difference as B2B prospects make a purchase decision after several rounds of evaluation.
A longer software sales cycle can turn out to be beneficial for B2B sales reps. It means there are a lot of opportunities for the sales professionals to hook the buyers throughout the sales cycle. This eventually means better chances of closing the sales deals.
Here are a few tips for developing and implementing effective sales strategies:
Your software sales strategy should aim at “showing the prospects how” and not “telling what to do”. A value-focused CTA makes all the difference in software sales calls. The goal of any software company should be to help prospects find a solution to their challenges without going into too much detail.
There are two ways to do that:
If you are providing a “Free Trial” option, you must be strategic about it. Offering too long free trials can result in long-term losses. The most common trial period offered by software companies is - 30 days. However, you can offer shorter trials too.
Here are a few options to keep your trial periods strategic:
7-day trial period - If the product you sell is straightforward and affordable, offering a 7-day trial period can be sufficient. A short trial period will ensure that your sales cycle is not unnecessarily extended.
14-day trial period - Multi-tier products with several advanced features require a little more time to comprehend. Hence, a two-week trial period is more suitable in those cases. It is enough time for the prospects to get an overview of the features and make a purchase decision.
30-day trial period - If your product is highly complex and belongs to the expensive price range, the maximum trial period you can offer is - 30 days. A month-long trial period is sufficient for multiple stakeholders to try the product and decide.
The B2B software industry is frequently changing. To sustain in this industry for a long period, businesses need to invest in the upskilling and training of the sales teams. The sales reps should receive consistent training to boost their product knowledge and improve their SaaS (Software as a Service) sales process.
The B2B sales training program can cover the following aspects:
Manual sales coaching can be time-consuming. In fact, it is difficult to offer targeted training to each sales rep manually.
The best way to provide real-time, automated coaching is to use a tool like - Salesken.
Salesken’s built-in sales coaching software can help sales teams to:
An ideal software sales strategy doesn’t focus on lead generation alone. It should also find new and innovative ways to retain customers for a long time. That’s where customer success comes into the picture.
Each sales team should have a customer success manager who closely interacts with the customers. Their responsibility is to ensure that the customers receive the value they were promised.
To achieve this, software businesses should create a feedback loop connecting customer touchpoints to the sales team. That way, whenever the customers have feedback about the product, the sales team can be notified.
Successful customer success initiatives help sales reps to sell more products, features and benefits to the same customer. For example, most software companies regularly release new solutions or upgrade existing software. They can sell these solutions to existing customers with successful customer success strategies before acquiring fresh leads.
A sales pitch deck is the presentation that sales reps use during sales calls to interact with and persuade the prospects. A great sales strategy is to develop effective pitch decks that clearly articulate the benefits associated with a product.
Here are a few tips for creating visually attractive and informative sales pitch decks:
Sales teams should collaborate with the marketing team to get content for the pitch decks. Adding high-quality, informative content can make it a winning sales pitch deck.
The significance of inbound marketing can never be ignored. Attracting potential users toward your sales funnel is challenging, but it is not impossible. A successful software sales strategy should be a mix of inbound and outbound activities.
The essence of inbound marketing is to create informative content that nurtures the prospects and pushes them toward the closing stage of the sales funnel.
Some of the simplest ways to power up inbound marketing activities include:
Software sales are all about adding value to the prospects. Therefore, we have shared some tried and tested strategies to help the sales reps evolve their career in software sales and achieve success.
If you are a sales manager or budding entrepreneur planning to develop a unique software solution, these strategies can help you take the first step.


There are three different types of software sales cycles with varying lengths.

7-day trial period - If the product you sell is straightforward and affordable, offering a 7-day trial period can be sufficient. A short trial period will ensure that your sales cycle is not unnecessarily extended.
14-day trial period - Multi-tier products with several advanced features require a little more time to comprehend. Hence, a two-week trial period is more suitable in those cases. It is enough time for the prospects to get an overview of the features and make a purchase decision.
30-day trial period - If your product is highly complex and belongs to the expensive price range, the maximum trial period you can offer is - 30 days. A month-long trial period is sufficient for multiple stakeholders to try the product and decide.
The B2B software industry is frequently changing. To sustain in this industry for a long period, businesses need to invest in the upskilling and training of the sales teams. The sales reps should receive consistent training to boost their product knowledge and improve their SaaS (Software as a Service) sales process.
The B2B sales training program can cover the following aspects:
Manual sales coaching can be time-consuming. In fact, it is difficult to offer targeted training to each sales rep manually.
The best way to provide real-time, automated coaching is to use a tool like - Salesken.
Salesken’s built-in sales coaching software can help sales teams to:
An ideal software sales strategy doesn’t focus on lead generation alone. It should also find new and innovative ways to retain customers for a long time. That’s where customer success comes into the picture.
Each sales team should have a customer success manager who closely interacts with the customers. Their responsibility is to ensure that the customers receive the value they were promised.
To achieve this, software businesses should create a feedback loop connecting customer touchpoints to the sales team. That way, whenever the customers have feedback about the product, the sales team can be notified.
Successful customer success initiatives help sales reps to sell more products, features and benefits to the same customer. For example, most software companies regularly release new solutions or upgrade existing software. They can sell these solutions to existing customers with successful customer success strategies before acquiring fresh leads.
A sales pitch deck is the presentation that sales reps use during sales calls to interact with and persuade the prospects. A great sales strategy is to develop effective pitch decks that clearly articulate the benefits associated with a product.
Here are a few tips for creating visually attractive and informative sales pitch decks:
Sales teams should collaborate with the marketing team to get content for the pitch decks. Adding high-quality, informative content can make it a winning sales pitch deck.
The significance of inbound marketing can never be ignored. Attracting potential users toward your sales funnel is challenging, but it is not impossible. A successful software sales strategy should be a mix of inbound and outbound activities.
The essence of inbound marketing is to create informative content that nurtures the prospects and pushes them toward the closing stage of the sales funnel.
Some of the simplest ways to power up inbound marketing activities include:
Software sales are all about adding value to the prospects. Therefore, we have shared some tried and tested strategies to help the sales reps evolve their career in software sales and achieve success.
If you are a sales manager or budding entrepreneur planning to develop a unique software solution, these strategies can help you take the first step.


There are three different types of software sales cycles with varying lengths.

A B2B sales cycle is specifically designed to assist sales teams throughout the prolonged B2B sales process. It is scalable and includes appropriate instructions that prospects can use from the prospecting stage to the conversion stage.
This guide will extensively describe the B2B sales process and its different stages to help the Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) close more deals. It also includes some of the success factors to drive the sales process.
A sales cycle is the combination of all stages that a sales rep must follow to convert a prospect into a customer. Businesses that follow sales cycles closely can:
The ultimate goal of any B2B sales team is to close more sales deals. Mapping up a sales process is the first step toward fulfilling that goal. A B2B sales process is a complex process that takes part between two businesses and requires complete collaboration from both sides to make it successful.
Sales reps are often caught explaining how they enjoy the freedom associated with their jobs. They find it compelling how they can connect with new prospects over cold calls and convince them with their strong persuasion skills. However, one of the proven ways to win sales deals is by deriving actionable insights from B2B sales datasets and developing a personalized sales process.
Here’s why sales teams need a dedicated B2B sales process to succeed:
The length of a sales cycle depends on multiple factors. Usually, it is a time-consuming process as multiple decision-makers are involved. However, the most common stages of a sales process are as follows:
A sales cycle starts with prospecting. The prospecting stage is all about identifying the potential customers who are currently at the evaluation stage of their buyer’s journey and are likely to find your commercial offer interesting.
Some of the major channels that help B2B sales reps in the prospecting process include:
The above steps can help sales professionals to identify ideal leads and ensure that the very first contact can be established through:
Knowing a product closely is essential for every B2B sales rep. However, to influence a buyer’s journey, sales reps must know the prospect’s business and their challenges. In fact, the difference between a good SDR and a great SDR lies in their level of research about the prospect.
The next stage in the sales process is in-depth prospect research. Here are some tips to capture more information about the prospects:
An unaltered principle in B2B sales is - Make your sales process need-driven, not product-driven. Hence, it is very important to identify prospects’ needs and match them with your product to understand whether or not your product can solve their problems.
With thorough research, sales reps can develop a fundamental idea about the prospects. However, they need to ask questions to know their pain points more efficiently. A set of thought-provoking, open-ended questions can help the reps gain more clarity and establish prospects’ reliability over your brand.
Here are a few questions to ask to accelerate the lead qualification process:
After the lead qualification stage, a sales rep will have a clear idea of the prospect’s intent, struggles, and how their product can help the prospects. Hence, in this sales cycle stage, reps should focus on crafting a tailored pitch.
Crafting a perfect sales pitch has its share of challenges. The pitch decides whether or not a prospect would proceed with a company. A good pitch should be brief, informative, and must consist of all your research insights.
Here are some quick tips to craft an effective B2B sales pitch:
A prospect can raise objections for multiple reasons like pricing, requesting additional features, queries about value addition, and so on. A B2B sales rep needs to address these objections with a positive approach and convert these objections into motivations to buy the product.
For example, if a prospect objects to the product's high price, remind them about the numerous benefits associated with it.
However, that’s not it. In B2B sales, it is very common to face recurring objections from prospects throughout the buyer’s journey. Hence, sales managers and VPs should make the SDRs aware of these challenges and include the correct approaches to resolve these in their sales playbook.
Closing is the most exciting and the most difficult stage in the sales cycle. By now, a prospect has clearly communicated the value of the product and addressed their objections and the only step left is to sign the contract and close the deal.
However, the closing stage is difficult because not all deals that reach this stage convert into closing. A research by Salesforce shows that only 28% of sales reps understand customers’ challenges and are more likely to close a deal. Therefore, the significance of customer-driven sales holds true in this stage too.
Sometimes, the reps need to negotiate pricing even in the closing stage. Providing the prospects with some free value like - a free trial for 14 days, free user guides, etc. can help in closing the deal.
Generally, after a sales call, reps should send the next steps, a recording of the conversation, and other useful resources over a follow-up mail. This nice gesture leaves the room open for more upsell and cross-sell opportunities.
A sales cycle is difficult to set up and even more challenging to execute! Here is a list of success factors to keep in mind to accelerate the B2B sales cycle for your brand:
Using the right set of sales tools can make a difference in your sales cycle. A tool that we found useful is - Salesken. It can help B2B organizations set up their sales cycle from scratch. Some of the core features of this tool include:

Forming an efficient sales team plays a critical role in the B2B sales process. A passionate and experienced sales manager must lead the team and encourage the reps to stay motivated throughout.
Also, it is important to assign the right person for the right responsibilities. For example, a person who enjoys interacting with others will be perfect for making cold calls and reaching out to the audience. Alternatively, a person with well-written communication skills can write outbound emails and messages for the team.
Additionally, a sales team should also have a dedicated coach who trains the new reps and helps them adapt to the company's sales processes.
A major success factor for a successful B2B sales process is to map the user’s journey. While most sales teams put efforts into creating and publishing content and launching ad campaigns, they often miss out on placing these assets in the appropriate channels to gain maximum visibility from the user.
The key here is to differentiate between entry-level and ready-to-convert users and segment your content accordingly. As soon as you segment your target audience and their position in the buyer’s journey, it will be easier to run successful campaigns and convert more users.
For each sales campaign, there should be:
Mapping the user journey can help accelerate the buyer’s journey and helps you simplify the conversion process.
There are different business users all over the internet, looking for the ideal products that can resolve their challenges. A sales rep’s job is to bridge the gap between the target users and the organization’s offerings. A great way to address this gap is by setting up a personalized sales cycle. It may be a time-consuming process, but it makes a lot of difference when planned correctly.
The length of a B2B sales cycle depends on many things like the product you are selling, the prospect company, no. of stakeholders involved, and so on. Though there is no specific length, a study by CSO insights points out that three-quarters of B2B sales take a minimum of 4 months to complete.

The seven stages of a sales process are:

What is the one practice that helps new sales reps understand the industry trends and experienced reps actively stay on the top? It is sales training.
B2B sales training is the key to developing sales teams with sensational performers who contribute to a company's long-term growth. Did you know that training the Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) can boost your ROI by 353%?
In fact, companies that provide B2B sales training can retain skilled talents for a long period. On the contrary, businesses that don’t take sales training seriously risk losing 40% of their employees within the first year itself.
We have prepared a detailed B2B sales training guide for sales managers, VPs, and sales reps to understand the importance, techniques, and processes of sales training in detail.
Every brand’s ultimate goal is to deliver value to the customers. A targeted and well-designed sales training program helps the SDRs to get an in-depth understanding of target customers’ profile, their pain points, and the solution the customer is looking for.
Again, this means identifying the value requirements of every customer and finding a way to deliver them. Sales managers are already well versed in value creation. Sales training aims to incorporate their knowledge into the B2B sales training programs.
A dedicated collaboration between the B2B sales and marketing teams can ensure the success of the sales training programs.
A B2B sales training program requires dedication to research, a targeted process, and compiling all business needs to be documented together. Designing sales training can never happen overnight.
Here is a quick checklist of the pointers to keep in mind for a streamlined B2B sales training program:
Introducing the new sales reps with the B2B sales process is very important. It is the first step to helping them get accustomed to the organization's sales framework and thoroughly understand the user’s journey.
A well-crafted sales process should move parallel with the customer’s journey. Here are some factors to discuss with the SDRs while explaining your company's sales process:
See how the above image shows a funnel-based overview of the B2B sales process. It highlights various stages of the sales funnel and the objectives of each of these stages. This kind of pictorial overview can eliminate the confusion of the reps and prepare them for handling the complex B2B sales process.
Sales representatives always work on the internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Hence, a sales training program should provide an overview of the CRM system and the dedicated process to follow for creating this system.
Here’s why SDRs must know about the CRM system in detail:
Craft an engaging story about the products and target customers. A story can easily engage the sales reps and build interest to learn more. They can then use and repeat this story to enhance their market understanding.
Planning to design your B2B sales training program? Here are a few techniques to help you out:
Sales professionals are regular people. It is common for them to feel overwhelmed with information overload. A recent study shows that multi-day sales training programs are not always effective. Sales reps tend to forget 50% of these sessions' learning within five weeks.
Rigorous training can become harmful for sales professionals and crush their motivation in the long run. A great replacement for long sales training sessions is - microlearning.
Microlearning is an approach where sales managers can coach the SDRs with small chunks of information at a time. Microlearning sales training is at best 10 to 15 minutes long. With microlearning, sales managers can retain the engagement of sales teams and enhance knowledge retention.
Here are some of the best ways to conduct microlearning successfully:
In B2B sales, handling objections is one of the greatest skills. Objections are inevitable in sales, and navigating through these objections successfully is what distinguishes a good sales rep from a great sales rep.
Some common reasons behind objections in B2B sales are
These are pretty common curveballs that sales reps might receive during sales calls. However, converting these objections into conversion is what makes a difference.
Practicing the art of handling objections is simple. During sales training, sales managers should teach the “They say-I say” approach. It can help the reps handle objections successfully and learn the process themselves.
It is a very simple process where an SDR needs to create a table as follows and add various responses from prospects’ and their perspectives:
Sales managers can provide various real-life scenarios during sales coaching sessions and see how reps can handle those rejections. This is a proven technique to get results during sales prospecting.
Social media plays a key role in B2B sales. According to HubSpot, buyers are 71% more likely to purchase from a brand based on social media referrals. Most B2B buyers complete their preliminary research on social media itself before reaching out to a brand.
The sales teams should be thoroughly trained in social selling. More so because social media is a faster and easier channel to reach out to prospects. In fact, 9 out of 10 B2B companies are on LinkedIn today, and sales teams can’t risk these opportunities by not improving their social selling skills.
Social selling should be part of your sales coaching program, and it should cover the following aspects closely:
Strong knowledge of the B2B industry should be the cornerstone of any sales coaching program. Comprehensive industry knowledge can help the B2B sales reps learn and implement new selling techniques. Here are a few components that should be part of an industry training session:
However, how do the business development professionals identify the quality leads?
Well, to achieve this, sales managers must teach them everything about the target customer profile. The SDRs should have in-depth knowledge of the target customers, their user persona, pain points, expected results, probable objections, etc.
This will help the sales reps to target ideal customers and craft personalized sales pitches to attract them.
A critical part of B2B sales training is to evaluate the sales performance of the business development managers and provide comprehensive feedback. Constructive feedback can motivate the sales representatives to do better. You can also share other reps’ success stories with the new SDRs to inspire them to do better.
A good sales training program should include the following components:
When a sales professional approaches a B2B customer, they might be well aware of some of the problems that require an immediate solution. However, there are many underlying problems that customers are unaware of. A successful B2B sales rep can educate the prospects and make them aware of the additional problems that their product can solve.
For example, suppose a sales rep is trying to sell productivity software to a prospect. The prospect is currently looking to find a way to streamline the internal projects and increase visibility. The productivity software addresses these pain points perfectly.
However, during the sales call, the rep identifies that the prospect requires analytics support too. That’s when they need to apply their upselling/cross-selling skills to explain the importance of analytics and how their product can help.
Upselling should be part of the sales coaching program to boost sales performance and increase the financial value of the sales deals.
Sales managers should train the reps closely on how to frame appropriate questions. Asking thought-provoking, open-ended questions can help a sales personnel move to the core of customers’ problems. Accordingly, they can craft their sales pitch. This is a super-useful exercise to coach the new sales reps.
Following-up is critical in the B2B sales process. Business decision-makers are often busy with a lot of things; a sales deal slips their mind. Hence, managers should teach the sales teams the following-up process. Note that the following process has to be spontaneous and not at all pushy.
Some of the questions to answer through this type of training are:
B2B sales training is the key to growing the sales teams' knowledge and boosting their confidence to make sales calls more efficiently. A well-trained sales rep can hold their ground during sales calls, represent data-backed arguments, handle objections smartly, and convert prospects like a pro.

B2B sales training is the key to developing sales teams with sensational performers who contribute to a company's long-term growth. Did you know that training the Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) can boost your ROI by 353%?
In fact, companies that provide B2B sales training can retain skilled talents for a long period. On the contrary, businesses that don’t take sales training seriously risk losing 40% of their employees within the first year itself.
We have prepared a detailed B2B sales training guide for sales managers, VPs, and sales reps to understand the importance, techniques, and processes of sales training in detail.
Every brand’s ultimate goal is to deliver value to the customers. A targeted and well-designed sales training program helps the SDRs to get an in-depth understanding of target customers’ profile, their pain points, and the solution the customer is looking for.
Again, this means identifying the value requirements of every customer and finding a way to deliver them. Sales managers are already well versed in value creation. Sales training aims to incorporate their knowledge into the B2B sales training programs.
A dedicated collaboration between the B2B sales and marketing teams can ensure the success of the sales training programs.
A B2B sales training program requires dedication to research, a targeted process, and compiling all business needs to be documented together. Designing sales training can never happen overnight.
Here is a quick checklist of the pointers to keep in mind for a streamlined B2B sales training program:
Introducing the new sales reps with the B2B sales process is very important. It is the first step to helping them get accustomed to the organization's sales framework and thoroughly understand the user’s journey.
A well-crafted sales process should move parallel with the customer’s journey. Here are some factors to discuss with the SDRs while explaining your company's sales process:
See how the above image shows a funnel-based overview of the B2B sales process. It highlights various stages of the sales funnel and the objectives of each of these stages. This kind of pictorial overview can eliminate the confusion of the reps and prepare them for handling the complex B2B sales process.
Sales representatives always work on the internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Hence, a sales training program should provide an overview of the CRM system and the dedicated process to follow for creating this system.
Here’s why SDRs must know about the CRM system in detail:
Craft an engaging story about the products and target customers. A story can easily engage the sales reps and build interest to learn more. They can then use and repeat this story to enhance their market understanding.
Planning to design your B2B sales training program? Here are a few techniques to help you out:
Sales professionals are regular people. It is common for them to feel overwhelmed with information overload. A recent study shows that multi-day sales training programs are not always effective. Sales reps tend to forget 50% of these sessions' learning within five weeks.
Rigorous training can become harmful for sales professionals and crush their motivation in the long run. A great replacement for long sales training sessions is - microlearning.
Microlearning is an approach where sales managers can coach the SDRs with small chunks of information at a time. Microlearning sales training is at best 10 to 15 minutes long. With microlearning, sales managers can retain the engagement of sales teams and enhance knowledge retention.
Here are some of the best ways to conduct microlearning successfully:
In B2B sales, handling objections is one of the greatest skills. Objections are inevitable in sales, and navigating through these objections successfully is what distinguishes a good sales rep from a great sales rep.
Some common reasons behind objections in B2B sales are
These are pretty common curveballs that sales reps might receive during sales calls. However, converting these objections into conversion is what makes a difference.
Practicing the art of handling objections is simple. During sales training, sales managers should teach the “They say-I say” approach. It can help the reps handle objections successfully and learn the process themselves.
It is a very simple process where an SDR needs to create a table as follows and add various responses from prospects’ and their perspectives:
Sales managers can provide various real-life scenarios during sales coaching sessions and see how reps can handle those rejections. This is a proven technique to get results during sales prospecting.
Social media plays a key role in B2B sales. According to HubSpot, buyers are 71% more likely to purchase from a brand based on social media referrals. Most B2B buyers complete their preliminary research on social media itself before reaching out to a brand.
The sales teams should be thoroughly trained in social selling. More so because social media is a faster and easier channel to reach out to prospects. In fact, 9 out of 10 B2B companies are on LinkedIn today, and sales teams can’t risk these opportunities by not improving their social selling skills.
Social selling should be part of your sales coaching program, and it should cover the following aspects closely:
Strong knowledge of the B2B industry should be the cornerstone of any sales coaching program. Comprehensive industry knowledge can help the B2B sales reps learn and implement new selling techniques. Here are a few components that should be part of an industry training session:
However, how do the business development professionals identify the quality leads?
Well, to achieve this, sales managers must teach them everything about the target customer profile. The SDRs should have in-depth knowledge of the target customers, their user persona, pain points, expected results, probable objections, etc.
This will help the sales reps to target ideal customers and craft personalized sales pitches to attract them.
A critical part of B2B sales training is to evaluate the sales performance of the business development managers and provide comprehensive feedback. Constructive feedback can motivate the sales representatives to do better. You can also share other reps’ success stories with the new SDRs to inspire them to do better.
A good sales training program should include the following components:
When a sales professional approaches a B2B customer, they might be well aware of some of the problems that require an immediate solution. However, there are many underlying problems that customers are unaware of. A successful B2B sales rep can educate the prospects and make them aware of the additional problems that their product can solve.
For example, suppose a sales rep is trying to sell productivity software to a prospect. The prospect is currently looking to find a way to streamline the internal projects and increase visibility. The productivity software addresses these pain points perfectly.
However, during the sales call, the rep identifies that the prospect requires analytics support too. That’s when they need to apply their upselling/cross-selling skills to explain the importance of analytics and how their product can help.
Upselling should be part of the sales coaching program to boost sales performance and increase the financial value of the sales deals.
Sales managers should train the reps closely on how to frame appropriate questions. Asking thought-provoking, open-ended questions can help a sales personnel move to the core of customers’ problems. Accordingly, they can craft their sales pitch. This is a super-useful exercise to coach the new sales reps.
Following-up is critical in the B2B sales process. Business decision-makers are often busy with a lot of things; a sales deal slips their mind. Hence, managers should teach the sales teams the following-up process. Note that the following process has to be spontaneous and not at all pushy.
Some of the questions to answer through this type of training are:
B2B sales training is the key to growing the sales teams' knowledge and boosting their confidence to make sales calls more efficiently. A well-trained sales rep can hold their ground during sales calls, represent data-backed arguments, handle objections smartly, and convert prospects like a pro.

Investing in sales training is one of the best decisions a business can make as it can save you time and effort and offer amazing returns. Sales training has several benefits. It can help reps identify valuable leads with higher purchase intent, help build better relationships and trust with prospects, increase job satisfaction within the sales team and increase your company’s overall sales and ROI.
There are over 13 million sales professionals, each with their own style, so there’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to training. Moreover, things are changing rapidly, sales processes are evolving and prospects are getting smarter. So organisations need to evolve too and deploy a thoughtful, data-driven approach to sales training to fit the individual reps.
Sales reps are always on the go to acquire, nurture and convert new leads. If they’re well-trained, they can better understand the prospects and their expectations and can convert leads faster and easier.
Here are the 8 best, actionable sales training ideas for sales teams to get started and skyrocket sales performance:
Sales training can provide the reps with the theoretical aspect of the sales process. But to provide them with practical exposure and check-in that reps are on a learning curve, sales managers need to engage them with industry case studies and assessments.
These assessments don’t have to be boring or difficult. You can make them fun and informative at the same time. Here’s how:
A sales enablement software is one of the best tools to train your reps with data-driven insights. A sales enablement software like SalesKen can analyse sales conversations to identify some in-depth insights and boost your sales productivity by 70%. These insights can come in handy during sales training as sales managers can easily get visibility into the strengths and weaknesses of individual reps and iterate and customise training accordingly. SalesKen, for instance, can identify any loopholes in your prospect-rep conversation and fix them in real-time.
An interactive peer learning session can help the reps learn and unlearn many critical aspects of the role. In fact, 91% of reps are in favour of such sessions.
For instance, if an experienced sales rep is retiring or leaving your organisation, get them to conduct a knowledge transfer session to discuss their experiences, learnings, and tips. Organisations can record these in video/audio format and use these resources to start their inside sales training for new joinees.
SalesKen, for instance, can help with peer learning as the software’s post-call analytics feature helps identify mistakes, so they're not repeated. As a result, average performing reps can learn from and replicate top performers’ strategies, and even well-performing reps can learn from what their peers are doing differently.
Objection handling is key to selling. Most objections aren’t unique-- they’re frequently repeated and predictable, so internal sales training must focus on refuting common objections, as well as provide a framework for dealing with new objections.
Instruct your reps to note down every unique objection they come across, so the entire sales team can evaluate the reasons for these objections together and find out potential solutions.
Attractive and informative presentations have always worked for sales reps. In SaaS sales trainings, mock presentation decks can be useful in explaining your products and services so reps can learn. You can help them understand the competitive advantage and USP of your product and plan their sales strategy accordingly.
Before arranging a sales training session, make sure that you have a competitor analysis handy. The idea is to understand competitors’ strengths and weaknesses and use this information in your sales pitch.
By handing over this competitor analysis document to your reps, you offer them quick exposure to your market positioning, a deeper understanding of various products and services and a complete overview of your competitors’ sales tactics. This can help your reps plan their sales pitch.
Have you heard about Selling Through Curiosity (STC)? It is one of the best sales training ideas to transform an early-stage business into a massive success. The purpose of STC is to engage with your prospects, ask questions, trigger critical thinking, and finally create your own assumptions about the prospect. It is all about educating your reps to stay curious and include STC within their sales strategy. The right combination of curiosity and genuineness can take your sales pitches to the next level.
Some common questions used in STC include “Tell me more” or “Why do you prefer it in this manner?” With STC, you can go deeper into the conversation and figure out what your prospects really want, which makes it easier to drive purchases.
A focus on continuous learning beyond just training can also help your reps in upskilling. Buy e-books, trade publications, tutorials and courses from industry experts and share them with your reps, so they can self-train. If you have a tight budget, subscribe to newsletters or other free resources. Many experienced marketers, sales professionals and companies send monthly/weekly newsletters, which are value-packed resources discussing the latest sales tricks and hacks. Your reps can learn a lot from these.
Remote sales teams have fewer opportunities to interact with prospects in person. In the post-pandemic world, virtual selling has become the “new normal” and in fact, 70% of sales reps believe that virtual sales techniques are much more effective than regular sales techniques. Training your sales team with remote selling skills has become a must-have.
Here’re a few tips for you to get started:
We hope you found these sales training ideas useful! With a great software like SalesKen, selling can be easy and fun for reps and managers alike! SalesKen can help augment your sales reps’ intelligence by leveraging the power of AI. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing and post-call data analytics can help you close sales faster and easier than ever before. So what are you waiting for? Book your demo now!

Phone calls. Emails. Meetings. More calls and more meetings.
Sales as a function are fast-paced and sometimes, it can get hard to ensure all the parts are running smoothly.
In 2022, increasing sales productivity is in fact, one of the fastest ways to increase sales.
Without a well-oiled sales engine in place, businesses cannot sustain themselves.
Not just that, sales teams are only as effective as they are efficient. By focusing on being productive, you can -
Here are 12 B2B sales productivity tips that sales leaders can leverage to position their teams to be highly productive and expedite their revenue engine -
Leveraging technology for every task may seem daunting, but it actually allows sales teams to simplify data capture, increase collaboration, and scale B2B sales strategies seamlessly.
Sales teams spend a chunk of their time working on administrative tasks - there's a glaring need for technology and tools that help sales teams improve their sales process.
One significant way to improve sales productivity is to utilize sales tools built for the modern landscape to reduce the amount of time spent on redundant tasks and free them up to generate more revenue.
Optimize, consolidate, and streamline everyday tasks with the help of sales tools!
To improve sales productivity across teams, it is imperative to understand where you currently stand.
Sales reports are incredible to help you visualize trends to gain deep, valuable insights into each sales rep's performance.
An intuitive sales platform such as Salesken allows sales managers to view their sales reps' activity logging with the help of a real-time dashboard.
Tracking the 5 must-know sales productivity metrics will help you understand where exactly your team is spending their time - conversion rates, average sales, actual vs forecast sales, lead follow-up, and close rate.
According to reports, sales representatives spent about 24% of their day selling and the rest was spent on doing routine, administrative tasks and prospecting.Research shows that sales reps spend 2/3 of their week doing redundant tasks such as importing leads, updating stages, responding to emails, and activity logging.Automate these routine tasks so sales reps can focus a significant amount of their time selling and on high-value activities.
Some of the sales process components that can be automated are -
Each kind of sales team typically has different schedules that may or may not be busier when compared to their counterparts.
The key is to get things done.
What works for one, may not work for another. But, therein lies the beauty of sales - there's ample opportunity for creativity and flexibility.
By maintaining and having a consistent everyday schedule, improving the overall productivity is a breeze.
Sales productivity demands a certain level of structure. However, not all aspects can be maintained due to other colliding work, which puts them in a tough spot.
Having a schedule helps sales teams prioritize their activities and place significant, long-term clients at the top of the list to ensure they always receive optimal, timely responses.
To set up a schedule, follow these four things -
Personalization elevates everyday processes and improves the overall business goals.
More than half of B2B consumers say that marketing personalization leads to higher conversion rates and closing deals.
The most efficient sales teams turn the process of personalization by integrating their existing systems that allow a sales rep to conduct the relevant research and weave data into an effective message seamlessly.
Personalize and streamline processes such as email templates, phone scripts, sales research, and more across the team to increase sales productivity metrics, speed, and consistency of your messaging.
Getting potential customers to respond to you, let alone engage with you, takes time and persistence.
If you decrease your sales activities and give up too soon, you're reducing the chances of turning that lead into a sale.
To overcome this problem, utilize a multi-channel sales sequence to ensure leads do not slip through the cracks as a result of not following up.
Leverage a sales intelligent tool to build and customize easy workflows for multi-channel outreach - texts, calls, emails, and visits. In addition, set intervals for when the next contact attempt should be made.
Boost overall sales productivity by following a sales sequence and testing out the workflow regularly to expedite the process.
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all buyer touchpoints have migrated online - including internal communication amongst the sales team.
Goodbye, team standups, and hello, Zoom meets!
The most productive sales teams leverage online collaborative tools where team members can easily understand the team's activities, priorities, and goals.
Virtual spaces allow sales teams to contribute easily with more visibility into the pipeline and also, coordinate with each other to improve engagement.
Sales leaders know that aligning teams around shared revenue goals is critical for capturing big accounts and increasing productivity.
The process of researching and finding appropriate prospects is a time-consuming task.
Fortunately, sales teams can automate the process with the help of a CRM tool, designed for sales reps to make a list of highly-targeted prospects that match your criteria.
An intuitive sales tool leverages high-functioning technology to filter through various unique data points to identify the right leads and not waste time on leads that do not convert.
Continuous learning definitely packs a punch, with a myriad of benefits to it.
The world of sales is ever-evolving. Be it a new sales technique, or an emergence of a novel tool, ensuring your sales team are up to date with the latest trends requires consistent coaching.
Not just that, typically, a sales team is brimming with middle-performers.
These middle-performers have the potential to perform at par with the best sellers - they just have to be coached with the right techniques and learn directly from top sellers.
By studying top sellers' notes from lost deals, sales leaders can extrapolate and learn new pain points, and thus, coach team members with techniques that meet the customers’ needs and improve the rep efficiency.
In order to drive revenue to your business, the most critical question to answer is - who are your customers?
A business cannot sell its product to everyone and anyone.
Understanding your ideal customer profile will create maximum value for your business which is crucial to increasing sales productivity.
Learning who your best customers are, coupled with market research, is a sure-shot way of spending more time prospecting more such customers, thus, increasing overall revenue for your business.
Lead scoring helps sales reps prioritize which potential customer needs more attention as opposed to the ones that do not.
It also helps you identify the perfect moment to respond to.
Set up lead scoring with the help of a sales intelligent tool to track the activities of your potential customers. Get notified every time your prospects trickle down to the next stage of the sales funnel so you can follow up accordingly.
If your sales metrics are not in place and ironed out, how do you know if your method is paying off?
Track key sales metrics to identify weak links in your sales process.
Carefully gauge and understand places where deals are slipping through the cracks to improve conversion rates and produce better results.
If a deal that could be easily won has instead slipped through the crack, having a better understanding of the reason behind it, and fixing it can drastically improve your sales game.
Create content that fits your narrative better, qualify leads that are highly likely to convert, and personalize your sales approach with the help of sales metrics.
With most sales leaders failing to understand the hurdles standing in the way of building an efficient sales team, there are four key pillars that serve as a foundational block to increasing sales productivity.
While sales effectiveness isn't just lip-service and requires out-of-the-box ideas to overcome mediocrity, understanding sales resources and tools to be at par with your competitors definitely helps.
Holding onto what's working just fine, isn't necessarily bad, however, it prevents progress.
Sales trends and marketing change rapidly and refusing to innovate new ideas such as producing creative video content or an overhaul of marketing ideas, and more importantly, hinders the overall sales productivity.
An essential component of consistency is based on a company's sales structure.
Wrinkle out the existing sales process and ensure to follow a sales process that has a higher rate of winning.
Use what works and share the same strategy within the company to drastically improve sales productivity.
We can't help but agree with the number of distractions that pull us away from reaching our daily goals.
Eliminate things that take away your focus from your everyday work and build a specific routine to ensure all essential tasks are completed and fit into your daily schedule.
The competitive nature of the sales landscape adds to the pressure to perform and meet monthly quotas.
Sometimes, even the best salesperson gets affected and thus, affects their performance.
Sales quotas that are perceived as being impossible to meet are likely to prevent your team members from even trying because they believe they might fail.
Re-evaluate sales quotas every quarter with your team to ensure they're attainable and yet interesting.
A combination of traditional selling methods with advanced technologies could be the way forward to improve sales productivity for your company.
Remember, the more time you save, the more chances your team gets to acquire more customers to increase sales and thus, revenue.
Salesken is the best sales engagement tool that will help your business to increase revenue, maximize productivity, and boost overall profitability.

Phone calls. Emails. Meetings. More calls and more meetings.
Sales as a function are fast-paced and sometimes, it can get hard to ensure all the parts are running smoothly.
In 2022, increasing sales productivity is in fact, one of the fastest ways to increase sales.
Without a well-oiled sales engine in place, businesses cannot sustain themselves.
Not just that, sales teams are only as effective as they are efficient. By focusing on being productive, you can -
Here are 12 B2B sales productivity tips that sales leaders can leverage to position their teams to be highly productive and expedite their revenue engine -
Leveraging technology for every task may seem daunting, but it actually allows sales teams to simplify data capture, increase collaboration, and scale B2B sales strategies seamlessly.
Sales teams spend a chunk of their time working on administrative tasks - there's a glaring need for technology and tools that help sales teams improve their sales process.
One significant way to improve sales productivity is to utilize sales tools built for the modern landscape to reduce the amount of time spent on redundant tasks and free them up to generate more revenue.
Optimize, consolidate, and streamline everyday tasks with the help of sales tools!
To improve sales productivity across teams, it is imperative to understand where you currently stand.
Sales reports are incredible to help you visualize trends to gain deep, valuable insights into each sales rep's performance.
An intuitive sales platform such as Salesken allows sales managers to view their sales reps' activity logging with the help of a real-time dashboard.
Tracking the 5 must-know sales productivity metrics will help you understand where exactly your team is spending their time - conversion rates, average sales, actual vs forecast sales, lead follow-up, and close rate.
According to reports, sales representatives spent about 24% of their day selling and the rest was spent on doing routine, administrative tasks and prospecting.Research shows that sales reps spend 2/3 of their week doing redundant tasks such as importing leads, updating stages, responding to emails, and activity logging.Automate these routine tasks so sales reps can focus a significant amount of their time selling and on high-value activities.
Some of the sales process components that can be automated are -
Each kind of sales team typically has different schedules that may or may not be busier when compared to their counterparts.
The key is to get things done.
What works for one, may not work for another. But, therein lies the beauty of sales - there's ample opportunity for creativity and flexibility.

The pandemic has forced many businesses to shift to a remote work setup.
Managing remote teams has its own set of perks and challenges. While you and your team can save countless hours on daily commuting, frequent meetings, seminars, etc., managers must ensure that the remote team is completely productive and handles all activities with complete transparency.
Regarding B2B sales, some common challenges associated with remote teams include poor collaboration, poor training, zero accountability, and so on. To eliminate these challenges, sales managers must provide a remote sales team with top-notch B2B sales tools.
We have segmented the B2B sales tools into six major categories: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Prospecting, Sales Enablement, Project Management, Email Marketing, and Analytics.
Here is a quick guide on which B2B sales tools you must use under each category to lead your sales team in the right direction.
A CRM tool stores potential customers’ contact details, identifies sales possibilities from generated leads and helps sales reps to stay updated with all the information about the leads and helps marketers to run marketing campaigns seamlessly. It is the single repository for all information regarding an organization’s target audiences.
A CRM software is a must-have for businesses of all sizes. It provides sales managers a quick overview of the sales pipeline and each lead's status. Here are the two CRM software tools that every sales team must use:
HubSpot is a leading CRM software that helps businesses to track prospects, analyze all lead information in the same place and create an outstanding customer experience with a great scaling potential.

Cold emails still account for 40 times more effectiveness than other sales outreach types. Every sales rep should master the art of cold emailing to attract and engage quality leads. However, sales reps are often too occupied with additional tasks like planning email campaigns, setting up email sequences, creating reports, etc. All of these can make the reps feel overwhelmed and become a blocker when it comes to writing personalized emails. An email marketing tool takes care of all these aspects to free-up sales reps’ time.
Mailchimp is an email marketing automation platform that helps sales reps to build and grow an audience by running successful email campaigns.

Remote working is the “new normal”. To survive this paradigm shift, B2B sales teams need a set of fast and effective tools to help the reps throughout the sales process. These tools can help businesses form a strong B2B sales process and close leads with fewer challenges.
All the tools mentioned in this article are fast, time-saving, and thoroughly helpful for B2B sales reps. Sales managers should ultimately focus on tools that fulfill their requirements and help them achieve success and workplace productivity.
There are various categories for sales tools, namely sales enablement, email marketing, analytics, and so on. Businesses can select these tools based on their priorities.

The pandemic has forced many businesses to shift to a remote work setup.
Managing remote teams has its own set of perks and challenges. While you and your team can save countless hours on daily commuting, frequent meetings, seminars, etc., managers must ensure that the remote team is completely productive and handles all activities with complete transparency.
Regarding B2B sales, some common challenges associated with remote teams include poor collaboration, poor training, zero accountability, and so on. To eliminate these challenges, sales managers must provide a remote sales team with top-notch B2B sales tools.
We have segmented the B2B sales tools into six major categories: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Prospecting, Sales Enablement, Project Management, Email Marketing, and Analytics.
Here is a quick guide on which B2B sales tools you must use under each category to lead your sales team in the right direction.
A CRM tool stores potential customers’ contact details, identifies sales possibilities from generated leads and helps sales reps to stay updated with all the information about the leads and helps marketers to run marketing campaigns seamlessly. It is the single repository for all information regarding an organization’s target audiences.
A CRM software is a must-have for businesses of all sizes. It provides sales managers a quick overview of the sales pipeline and each lead's status. Here are the two CRM software tools that every sales team must use:
HubSpot is a leading CRM software that helps businesses to track prospects, analyze all lead information in the same place and create an outstanding customer experience with a great scaling potential. HubSpot’s built-in Sales Hub along with Marketing Hub, Operations Hub, and other tools make it a must-use tool for sales managers and B2B sales teams.

This scalable CRM tool can help businesses to close more deals and achieve exponential growth.

The purpose of prospecting tools is to support the sales reps in identifying potential prospects, running effective outreach campaigns, converting those prospects, and prioritizing high-intent leads. One of the best B2B prospecting tools is LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

B2B sales teams can use this platform to manage different stages of the sales funnel, from tracking leads, engagement, and collaboration. It is a great way to visualize your entire sales pipeline, track different user accounts, and collaborate on sales deals.

Cold emails still account for 40 times more effectiveness than other sales outreach types. Every sales rep should master the art of cold emailing to attract and engage quality leads. However, sales reps are often too occupied with additional tasks like planning email campaigns, setting up email sequences, creating reports, etc. All of these can make the reps feel overwhelmed and become a blocker when it comes to writing personalized emails. An email marketing tool takes care of all these aspects to free-up sales reps’ time.
Mailchimp is an email marketing automation platform that helps sales reps to build and grow an audience by running successful email campaigns. Mailchimp can auto-segment leads and help sales teams segregate between high-intent and low-intent leads.

#1 Sales Analytics Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Sales analytics software helps you gain insights into your customer’s needs and purchase trends in the market by creating granular sales reports. By segmenting your audiences, it can help identify the commonalities among individuals that aid in improving your sales calls. The actionable insights allow sales teams to identify customers' concerns, quickly customize their sales calls, and improve the overall conversion rates. Stay ahead of your competitors by following the market trends.
Dig deep into your data, analyze each call, and identify vital trends in sales with a sales analytics software. This will enable you to sell faster and more efficiently while accurately identifying high-value prospects. Sales reps can transform this analysis into something useful that will guide them in identifying new sales opportunities and closing more deals than ever before.
By analyzing your sales, you can identify your most profitable products and the ones that aren’t performing good. Not only that, but you can also identify your most profitable customers and potential sales. All this information can help you drive your business forward and build a sales strategy that will help increase your revenue. Besides, a sales analytics software gives you a better understanding of your current cash flow position and what it will look like in the future.
Customers today expect personalized calls and offers driven by their interests and preferences, and recent interactions. Sales reps should be able to make relevant offers to the most potential prospects at the right time via the appropriate channels. With real-time cues, sales reps can adapt faster to the customers' preferences, orchestrate new offers based on customer behavior, and assist them further in their buying journey.
For companies to succeed today, the entire organization and departments must work in collaboration. Having a sales analytics software where everyone shares the same dashboard allows them to keep track of different activities happening within the organization and check whether they are aligned with the common goals. Moreover, it makes it easy for sales reps to create and share reports and stay up to date with all data and files.


Predictive analytics
It involves gauging present and past sales data to predict future patterns and market trends. It helps your sales team forecast your sales revenue for a period so that you can take the needed course of action to achieve your goals.
Diagnostic analytics:
As the name suggests, it helps examine and determine why something occurs. For instance, it can help identify the roadblocks being faced by your sales team that are stopping them from achieving their targets.
Descriptive analytics
Descriptive analytics study your historical sales data and make comparisons to better understand what's happening currently.
Prescriptive analytics
It takes predictive analytics one step further by recommending the best course of action to help your sales team reach their goals.




Manual data collection and entry in an organization carry the risk of duplication and/or omission, even when you have data-minded staff manning the keyboards. When data is duplicated, it leads to extra work and inaccurate predictions about your customers' needs and revenue numbers. So instead, rely on a sales analytics solution that gathers its own data from multiple platforms, organizes and maintains it, and even runs a proper analysis that gives out accurate forecasts and insights for decision making.
Another common challenge in sales analytics management is the lack of understanding of how to use the data at hand. The sales department might have a complete record of all the necessary data, such as call recordings, call scripts and other important and crucial data. However, they may not be able to grasp the exact value of each piece of data and how they can leverage it to drive the growth of their business. Having an effective dashboard reporting system can provide an at-a-glance overview of how your business is operating. It can simplify the sales data into appealing visuals that can be easily comprehended.
Simply having a CRM, you do not get access to historical insight valuable to your sales team. It renders the whole process of data analysis worthless. A traditional CRM can only provide an isolated and limited snapshot of sales and customer data. In this fast-paced world where market trends change fast, you need a more robust analytical solution. Implementing an end-to-end sales analytical solution will also provide insights into your buyer's journey, current market situations, and accurate data.
Market trends constantly evolve, and today’s customers demand great satisfaction and expect value for convenience. Getting ahead of your customer's needs is crucial to stay ahead of your competitors and gaining your customers' loyalty. Staying updated on changing customer behavior can be difficult, let alone predicting the future. Thus, leveraging tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning can help with predictive analysis and provide real-time insights into your customers' behaviors.
One major issue in sales performance data analytics is that only a third of sales leaders seem to trust the analytics generated from their business operations. The reason could be the lack of a proper data-sourcing process and analysis. It's crucial to align people, processes, and tools to ensure data transparency within the organizations. As a sales leader, you must also create a data-driven mindset for your teams.

Here's why your business needs a sales analytics tool.
Sales analytics refers to the process of gathering, modeling, and understanding sales performance data to gauge the overall sales performance of sales teams. Sales leaders use these insights to form business strategies and accurately forecast sales and future revenue. The Sales Analytics software simplifies the data in easy-to-understand visuals such as graphs, charts, and more. It helps you understand your department's performance, different sales trends, and opportunities.
Types of Sales Analytics Typically, sales analytics is divided into four categories:
From call insights and real-time cues to closing more deals
Real-time cues with Salesken's sales analytics software help you identify what's going on in the conversation and quickly adapt to the callers' preferences and needs. These cues are with respect to general small talk or a specific feature depending on what's being said in the conversation. It helps you discover customers' needs better instead of simply jumping into your pitch without paying any heed to your lead's requirements.
Salesken monitors 100% of customer interactions for quality assurance and automatically brings attention to the necessary calls. It eliminates the process of random call sampling for quality checks and instead picks up the main signals to track both what the rep and the customer are saying so that you don't miss out on any important information.
Salesken's sales analytics software records all calls and runs an analysis in just a few seconds. It generates insights that help boost your sales teams to scale their performance and improve efficiency. Besides, Salesken takes the load off you and enables call quality assurance monitoring in half the time, thus enhancing your agent's overall call-to-quality analyst ratio.
Salesken's business intelligence platform helps you organize and visualize your data in an easy-to-understand format. It connects all the data sources you want to analyze and allows you to access your sales journey with pre-built visualization or create your own reports. Having a basic understanding of what data to analyze and which visualization to use will further improve your reporting and enhance your business operations.
Salesken captures customer interactions from all channels—calls, video conferences, emails, text messages, and others. It gives you a clear visibility into your pipeline—win-lose rate, pending deals, follow-up calls, sales reps' performance rate, etc. It eliminates the need for any guesswork and provides assistance at every stage of the funnel.
Onboarding new sales reps can be a time-consuming process if not done right. However, using Salesken's Sales Analytics tools ensures that your new reps spend less time ramping up and more in landing new deals. It helps train new reps by quickly highlighting the best sales calls to listen to and preparing them with customized sales pitches for better results.
In order for in-depth analysis, Salesken's Sales Analytics software has to pull out data from all data recording systems. To give you access to a full-fledged business intelligence tool, the platform can automatically sync all your data from various CRMs and provide a detailed analysis of all your sales team’s performance.
Salesken's Sales Analytics software listens to 100s of conversations along with other relevant materials, such as FAQs and Sales Playbook, to provide real-time cues to sales reps while on the sales calls. This sales analytics tool not only boosts their confidence but also helps improve their overall performance. The tool can easily detect the tone of the caller, suggesting their feelings which could be classified as emotional, generic, or others (depending on the situation), and provide cues based on the conversation.
Salesken's Sales Analytics tool gives out the ‘intent to buy’ score that helps you and your sales team determine which deal has the highest possibility of being won/secured. The platform analyzes thousands of conversations and provides scores based on signals raised, questions asked, and other criteria. Now get a clear picture of your pipeline rather than just relying on your sales reps' gut feeling, which is important undoubtedly, but is not always accurate. Make decisions based on AI-powered, accurate forecasts and improve the performance of your sales department.
Spend less time auditing the calls of every sales rep and more time improving performance with a solution built specifically around your needs. With a sales analytics tool like Salesken, you get complete visibility into your sales reps' performance. Identify the best sales calls, deliveries, conversations, and closures, and bookmark them for your sales team to listen to them. It also brings special attention to spot critical issues and allows sales managers to coach and hold reps accountable for follow-through.
Provide your sales reps with essential, easy-to-use tools that allow them to quickly visualize their activities, including the number of calls made, the number of deals closed, follow up calls, etc. Salesken's Sales Analytics tool will automatically send out reminders for follow up calls, help prioritize products and leads based on the score, leverage real-time reports with a visual dashboard and do so much more.
Salesken's Sales Analytics tool collects data from various sources and makes it available on a single platform. It automatically generates reports weekly, monthly, or yearly as required and helps your sales leaders and executives get a clear understanding of sales performance and make strategic decisions to further improve the performance. Now easily manage and reward reps' performances with insightful reporting tools.
Accumulate data from all sources, including phone calls, emails, text, live chat, and other applications, and blend them into a single dashboard with distinct sales analytics tools. Using Salesken's Sales Analytics platform, you can easily define metrics per your business's unique needs. Seamlessly analyze these data from various functions and access end-to-end business insights, thus transforming the growth and revenue models.
The best Sales Analytics software helps both sales managers and reps in identifying opportunities and increase revenue.
Quickly identify your hot leads and customize the sales pitch on the call itself. Our real-time cues during the call help determine customer needs better, thus increasing the chance of a conversion.
Our interactive and intuitive dashboard allows sales managers to visualize numbers easily and customize their selling plans. Besides, the accuracy of data helps you gain confidence from their investors and other stakeholders.
In general, onboarding new sales reps takes two to five months. While it's essential to properly train a new agent about your product and audiences, the long ramp time means they are spending less time on landing clients. Our analytics tool helps shorten this onboarding process by curating the best learning materials, resulting in a better retention rate, faster quota attainment, and accelerated revenue generation.
To ensure maximum efficiency from a sales analytics tool, it's crucial to understand what impacts the result. Here are a few common challenges that are typically faced during sales data analysis.
Leverage the power of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology and get actionable insights into sales performances. We aim to help sales professionals and teams achieve peak performance and help every organization maximize efficiency, transparency, and revenue.
Salesken's sales analytics software captures 100% of conversations across various channels, including past call records, emails, chats, and other integrated media.
The software then runs a predictive analysis that helps understand customers' needs, identifies opportunities to improve sales pitches, enhances customer experience, and enables effortless closure of deals.
Salesken's algorithm also searches for different market trends and identifies patterns for predicting customer behavior for better sales decisions.
Once the analysis is done, it provides easy data visualization that can drive actionable insights across multiple business functions and unlock greater opportunities.
5 Factors to Look for in a Sales Analytics Tool
96% of B2B sales teams have partially or fully moved to remote selling. It's vital for employees to be able to access reports from anywhere in the world in real time. You should be able to view the performance of the whole sales department on your smartphone or desktop via an interactive online dashboard to make decisions on the go.
Manually generating resorts can keep businesses from truly utilizing their full potential. Not only can it be time-consuming, but the data can also be rendered obsolete in just a few days. A good sales analytics solution automates the process of generating reports with your most relevant data as and when required. You don't need to wait hours to run an analysis and have it automatically delivered to your email at the pre-defined timeline. Besides, you can ensure that your reports are password-protected in case of confidential information.
Having a clean sales dashboard is essential when it comes to reporting to clients, investors, and management. It provides a macro perspective of your business performance and can easily convey insights in a clear and understandable manner. It stays updated with company date information without having to work on it manually.
A sales data analytics software gathers data from across all the channels and acts as a unified platform whereby all the data are sorted and organized. It then analyzes the combined, relevant data to provide actionable insights, including prospect-to-conversion rate, pipeline visibility, deals won and lost, and more.

The basic functionality of good call recording software includes recording calls and keeping them organized in a database. Most of them might even help with transcribing the call. However, it's not feasible for sales calls to listen to thousands of calls for quality assurance and coaching purposes. Salesken's Signal Detection Capabilities help identify the keywords/phrases during each call. It could be Objections, Objection handling, or Lead Qualifying questions. You can use these insights to identify your top performer and share their best practices of how they handle objections with your other team members for learning purpose. Besides, Salesken sends out real-time cues while on the call itself. These conversation snippets are based on the unique call profile and positively influence your prospects' minds. It comes up with the best responses to your prospect's queries and assists your reps in customizing their sales pitch in real-time. And once the call is over, Salesken analyzes the call and gives out a pitch score. A pitch score is given by exploring all the signals that were raised and how the rep addressed them. Then, it compares it with the successful call and gives out a score on a scale of 1-100. It helps identify whether your rep performed well or not and the areas that need improvement for their next conversation.
Salesken's Call Engine is intelligently built that runs in the background and listens to live conversations. It has four engines—Generic, Emotion, FAQs & Playbook, and Historic. Each of them pops up depending on how it is set or based on the conversation that is happening in real time. These conversation snippets positively influence your prospects' minds, give out the best responses to objections, and assist your reps in real time in closing more deals.
Salesken provides end-to-end actionable insights into all your sales activities. It can generate a vast number of reports based on the metrics you want to track, including the number of sales calls made, the number of deals won/lost, revenue forecast, the performance of each sales rep, and much more, customized to each variable. It can generate reports in real time and provide insights into easy-to-understand visuals so that the concerned person can easily grasp the meaning of it and make strategic decisions for the growth of the business.

Here's why your business needs a sales analytics tool.
Sales analytics refers to the process of gathering, modeling, and understanding sales performance data to gauge the overall sales performance of sales teams. Sales leaders use these insights to form business strategies and accurately forecast sales and future revenue. The Sales Analytics software simplifies the data in easy-to-understand visuals such as graphs, charts, and more. It helps you understand your department's performance, different sales trends, and opportunities.
Types of Sales Analytics Typically, sales analytics is divided into four categories:
From call insights and real-time cues to closing more deals
Real-time cues with Salesken's sales analytics software help you identify what's going on in the conversation and quickly adapt to the callers' preferences and needs. These cues are with respect to general small talk or a specific feature depending on what's being said in the conversation. It helps you discover customers' needs better instead of simply jumping into your pitch without paying any heed to your lead's requirements.
Salesken monitors 100% of customer interactions for quality assurance and automatically brings attention to the necessary calls. It eliminates the process of random call sampling for quality checks and instead picks up the main signals to track both what the rep and the customer are saying so that you don't miss out on any important information.
Salesken's sales analytics software records all calls and runs an analysis in just a few seconds. It generates insights that help boost your sales teams to scale their performance and improve efficiency. Besides, Salesken takes the load off you and enables call quality assurance monitoring in half the time, thus enhancing your agent's overall call-to-quality analyst ratio.
Salesken's business intelligence platform helps you organize and visualize your data in an easy-to-understand format. It connects all the data sources you want to analyze and allows you to access your sales journey with pre-built visualization or create your own reports. Having a basic understanding of what data to analyze and which visualization to use will further improve your reporting and enhance your business operations.
Salesken captures customer interactions from all channels—calls, video conferences, emails, text messages, and others. It gives you a clear visibility into your pipeline—win-lose rate, pending deals, follow-up calls, sales reps' performance rate, etc. It eliminates the need for any guesswork and provides assistance at every stage of the funnel.
Onboarding new sales reps can be a time-consuming process if not done right. However, using Salesken's Sales Analytics tools ensures that your new reps spend less time ramping up and more in landing new deals. It helps train new reps by quickly highlighting the best sales calls to listen to and preparing them with customized sales pitches for better results.
In order for in-depth analysis, Salesken's Sales Analytics software has to pull out data from all data recording systems. To give you access to a full-fledged business intelligence tool, the platform can automatically sync all your data from various CRMs and provide a detailed analysis of all your sales team’s performance.
Salesken's Sales Analytics software listens to 100s of conversations along with other relevant materials, such as FAQs and Sales Playbook, to provide real-time cues to sales reps while on the sales calls. This sales analytics tool not only boosts their confidence but also helps improve their overall performance. The tool can easily detect the tone of the caller, suggesting their feelings which could be classified as emotional, generic, or others (depending on the situation), and provide cues based on the conversation.
Salesken's Sales Analytics tool gives out the ‘intent to buy’ score that helps you and your sales team determine which deal has the highest possibility of being won/secured. The platform analyzes thousands of conversations and provides scores based on signals raised, questions asked, and other criteria. Now get a clear picture of your pipeline rather than just relying on your sales reps' gut feeling, which is important undoubtedly, but is not always accurate. Make decisions based on AI-powered, accurate forecasts and improve the performance of your sales department.
Spend less time auditing the calls of every sales rep and more time improving performance with a solution built specifically around your needs. With a sales analytics tool like Salesken, you get complete visibility into your sales reps' performance. Identify the best sales calls, deliveries, conversations, and closures, and bookmark them for your sales team to listen to them. It also brings special attention to spot critical issues and allows sales managers to coach and hold reps accountable for follow-through.
Provide your sales reps with essential, easy-to-use tools that allow them to quickly visualize their activities, including the number of calls made, the number of deals closed, follow up calls, etc. Salesken's Sales Analytics tool will automatically send out reminders for follow up calls, help prioritize products and leads based on the score, leverage real-time reports with a visual dashboard and do so much more.
Salesken's Sales Analytics tool collects data from various sources and makes it available on a single platform. It automatically generates reports weekly, monthly, or yearly as required and helps your sales leaders and executives get a clear understanding of sales performance and make strategic decisions to further improve the performance. Now easily manage and reward reps' performances with insightful reporting tools.
Accumulate data from all sources, including phone calls, emails, text, live chat, and other applications, and blend them into a single dashboard with distinct sales analytics tools. Using Salesken's Sales Analytics platform, you can easily define metrics per your business's unique needs. Seamlessly analyze these data from various functions and access end-to-end business insights, thus transforming the growth and revenue models.
The best Sales Analytics software helps both sales managers and reps in identifying opportunities and increase revenue.
Quickly identify your hot leads and customize the sales pitch on the call itself. Our real-time cues during the call help determine customer needs better, thus increasing the chance of a conversion.
Our interactive and intuitive dashboard allows sales managers to visualize numbers easily and customize their selling plans. Besides, the accuracy of data helps you gain confidence from their investors and other stakeholders.
In general, onboarding new sales reps takes two to five months. While it's essential to properly train a new agent about your product and audiences, the long ramp time means they are spending less time on landing clients. Our analytics tool helps shorten this onboarding process by curating the best learning materials, resulting in a better retention rate, faster quota attainment, and accelerated revenue generation.
To ensure maximum efficiency from a sales analytics tool, it's crucial to understand what impacts the result. Here are a few common challenges that are typically faced during sales data analysis.
Leverage the power of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology and get actionable insights into sales performances. We aim to help sales professionals and teams achieve peak performance and help every organization maximize efficiency, transparency, and revenue.
Salesken's sales analytics software captures 100% of conversations across various channels, including past call records, emails, chats, and other integrated media.
The software then runs a predictive analysis that helps understand customers' needs, identifies opportunities to improve sales pitches, enhances customer experience, and enables effortless closure of deals.
Salesken's algorithm also searches for different market trends and identifies patterns for predicting customer behavior for better sales decisions.
Once the analysis is done, it provides easy data visualization that can drive actionable insights across multiple business functions and unlock greater opportunities.
5 Factors to Look for in a Sales Analytics Tool
96% of B2B sales teams have partially or fully moved to remote selling. It's vital for employees to be able to access reports from anywhere in the world in real time. You should be able to view the performance of the whole sales department on your smartphone or desktop via an interactive online dashboard to make decisions on the go.
Manually generating resorts can keep businesses from truly utilizing their full potential. Not only can it be time-consuming, but the data can also be rendered obsolete in just a few days. A good sales analytics solution automates the process of generating reports with your most relevant data as and when required. You don't need to wait hours to run an analysis and have it automatically delivered to your email at the pre-defined timeline. Besides, you can ensure that your reports are password-protected in case of confidential information.
Having a clean sales dashboard is essential when it comes to reporting to clients, investors, and management. It provides a macro perspective of your business performance and can easily convey insights in a clear and understandable manner. It stays updated with company date information without having to work on it manually.
A sales data analytics software gathers data from across all the channels and acts as a unified platform whereby all the data are sorted and organized. It then analyzes the combined, relevant data to provide actionable insights, including prospect-to-conversion rate, pipeline visibility, deals won and lost, and more.

The basic functionality of good call recording software includes recording calls and keeping them organized in a database. Most of them might even help with transcribing the call. However, it's not feasible for sales calls to listen to thousands of calls for quality assurance and coaching purposes. Salesken's Signal Detection Capabilities help identify the keywords/phrases during each call. It could be Objections, Objection handling, or Lead Qualifying questions. You can use these insights to identify your top performer and share their best practices of how they handle objections with your other team members for learning purpose. Besides, Salesken sends out real-time cues while on the call itself. These conversation snippets are based on the unique call profile and positively influence your prospects' minds. It comes up with the best responses to your prospect's queries and assists your reps in customizing their sales pitch in real-time. And once the call is over, Salesken analyzes the call and gives out a pitch score. A pitch score is given by exploring all the signals that were raised and how the rep addressed them. Then, it compares it with the successful call and gives out a score on a scale of 1-100. It helps identify whether your rep performed well or not and the areas that need improvement for their next conversation.
Salesken's Call Engine is intelligently built that runs in the background and listens to live conversations. It has four engines—Generic, Emotion, FAQs & Playbook, and Historic. Each of them pops up depending on how it is set or based on the conversation that is happening in real time. These conversation snippets positively influence your prospects' minds, give out the best responses to objections, and assist your reps in real time in closing more deals.
Salesken provides end-to-end actionable insights into all your sales activities. It can generate a vast number of reports based on the metrics you want to track, including the number of sales calls made, the number of deals won/lost, revenue forecast, the performance of each sales rep, and much more, customized to each variable. It can generate reports in real time and provide insights into easy-to-understand visuals so that the concerned person can easily grasp the meaning of it and make strategic decisions for the growth of the business.

Did you know that sales reps spend only 35.2% of their time on selling? In fact, intentionally or unintentionally, the majority of their time is spent on non-sales activities like research and administration.
As a sales manager, you should try to minimise your reps’ involvement in non-sales activities and optimise their involvement in selling. That’s where the concept of sales process automation can help you.
Sales automation is the process of automating all manual activities for a sales team to ensure that reps are staying productive and are spending their time on the one top thing they’re supposed to do - selling.
This article will discuss the seven key components of sales process automation to help you get started.
So, let’s begin.
One of the first sales automation benefits is prospecting or lead generation automation. It can be challenging for a rep to generate new leads, nurture them, and convert them. Reps require some kind of assistance with all these, and the best way to deal with this is through sales automation software.
A sales automation software can analyse the leads in your sales pipeline and assign them to the most skilled reps. It uses various factors like geographic location, past experience, and other specific criteria to assign reps with a prospect. This will surely improve your conversion rate.
A sales automation tool uses static data and insights from your previous prospects to create a target prospect profile. In this manner, it can automate your lead generation process and find you the ideal prospects that best match your services. That means reps can spend less time on prospecting and instead concentrate on actually converting those prospects.
Are your reps spending hours on writing personalised, error-free email copies to convert leads? Well, let us tell you that that’s a waste of their time. According to HubSpot, up to 50% of personalisation is enough for your sales emails. Beyond that, it may bring negative results to your sales team. So, if you’re trying to leverage email marketing, do it smartly.
You can just create a few email templates and automate the process. That way, they’ll reach your prospects’ inboxes without any manual effort from your reps. In fact, these email marketing automation tools come with advanced tracking features. They can help you discover super useful KPIs like open rates, Click-Through Rates (CTR), unsubscribes, and so on. Hence, setting up an insightful email campaign will become easier with such a tool by your side.
Do you monitor the sales performance of your reps? If you don’t know what or how much your reps are capable of, how can you assign them with relevant leads? You need a sales process automation tool to analyse your sales calls to provide you with actionable insights into reps’ performance.
You can use SalesKen’s AI-enabled sales performance automation tool to avail the following benefits:
One of the most tedious activities that each sales team handles is related to contract management. Reps need to prepare and send a large volume of sales contracts and proposals regularly to close deals. How about getting an automation tool? Such sales process automation tools come with plenty of features and analytics and can expedite your sales process to a large extent.
They help you create sales proposals, documents, and other collateral at the fastest speed. Plus, this software offers you an analytical overview of whether the prospect has opened the contract or not, any updates from the prospect’s side, and so on. Hence, you can easily leverage such an automation tool in your favour and improve your sales team’s productivity.
Did you know that 44% of reps give up on a prospect after just one follow-up? Know that your target customers are busy with several activities and engagements. Most of the time, they forget to get in touch with reps even though they’re interested in a product. So, if you don’t follow-up, you risk losing out on some valuable leads.
But manual follow-ups can be time-consuming. Writing follow-up emails every time or pasting the same follow-up emails over and over will only reduce your reps’ productivity. So, what you can do is simply create a few templates and then automate them. That’s basically scheduling your follow-up emails to ensure that you’re chasing each valuable lead twice or thrice.
This can be a fruitful practice for your sales team. With sales automation software, you can always stay in the loop on what your prospects are thinking, in which stage of decision making they are in, and whether they are even considering your product or service or not. All this information can provide you with greater clarity over your sales strategy.
Scheduling meetings is a regular task for the sales reps. But how convenient is it to send meeting invitations over email? Especially when you send an invitation and your prospect has some conflict with the time and they reschedule and so on. To put it simply, scheduling meetings over email can be a mess!
So, how about using a sales process automation tool that takes care of scheduling meetings for your team? Such a tool provides your prospects with direct access to your calendar. That way, they can select slots that match both of your availability. All you have to do is add the scheduling link to your emails and the prospects can complete the rest on their own. This kind of secondary sales automation tool can save hours of time spent on countless emails.
Your sales reps need guidance with the whole process. A B2B process automation tool that helps the reps during their sales journey can be a game-changer. SalesKen’s sales enablement tool can be your rep’s BFF when it comes to automated sales guidance.
You can analyse the sales calls in real-time, identify the right hooks to convert the right group of customers, build data-driven sales strategies to qualify more leads and lots more!
We hope that you now have a deeper understanding of sales automation and its benefits. Remember that your sales reps are already handling tricky activities like cold calling, lead qualifying and more. The last thing they need is for their organisation to make their job more challenging with tons of manual activities.

Customers are the bloodline of any business and the sales team is their backbone.
Finding new customers is key to growth and so is sustaining the ones you already have and building strong relationships with them.
With the right technology, this process can seem like a breeze.
Typically, businesses looking to automate their business processes look at two primary solutions - sales software and customer relationship management (CRM).
While sales software helps sales teams stay organized and streamline their process, a CRM, on the other hand, is to manage all your customer relationships in one place.
But, which one will bring more value to your business, and most importantly, why do you need these types of softwares?
In this blog post, we'll answer your questions. Let's begin.
Sales software is a digital tool that aids businesses stay organized by streamlining their sales operations.
A sales software optimizes, streamlines, and shortens the sales cycle, thus helping sales reps to accelerate the selling of a product and ensuring sales representatives have access to sales tools that help them meet their key sales performance benchmarks.
Sales software can be equivalent to the already existing software from your sales stack to increase the opportunities of acquiring paying customers.
In any business, the process of lead generation alone isn't sufficient - identifying leads that convert is even more important.
This will ultimately enhance the usage of sales resources and increase the chances of conversion to paying customers.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a type of technology to manage your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers.
A CRM system helps businesses stay connected to customers, improve profitability, and enhance relatability to streamline processes.
A CRM solution helps sales representatives focus on your business's relationships with individual people - including vendors, customers, suppliers, and more in a single place - throughout the sales lifecycle including lead generation, providing support, winning their business, and more.
Often, people confuse sales software and a customer relationship management tool.
In fact, the differences are quite striking.
A sales software helps businesses manage every step of the sales cycle right from the first inquiry to the first order, onboarding, payment, and billing.
A CRM software is a digital tool leveraged by businesses to manage their interactions with existing and potential customers.
The CRM software integrates with the marketing platforms to pull the information on leads and lets sales reps initiate a point of contact with potential customers. The CRM also lets sales reps follow up with prospects until they are pushed to the final stage of the sales process.
At this stage, sales software helps sales representatives manage their sales cycle in every stage. Then, the CRM continues the interaction with customers via regular communication channels.
Some of the key features of a sales software are -
Sales software provides sales representatives with information about overall revenue, conversion rates, length of the sales cycle, team performance, and more data.
This data can provide an overview of the overall health of the business and track it too.
Accessing sales reports, regardless of their timeline, with sales software has never been easier.
Track past and current sales accounts and easily reconcile them for sales representatives and stay on top of those deals!
A sales software should be able to manage and streamline every customer interaction, including onboarding, payment, and billing easily.
A vital capability of software sales is to manage and update inventory as and when products are being sold.
This can help sales representatives stay ahead of the demand and reduce shortage costs.
Sales teams are way more effective when they understand how likely a lead is going to convert.
With the leverage of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, sales representatives can easily focus on the leads that have high chances of converting.
In addition, with the help of data intelligence, businesses can rely on software sales to receive accurate sales forecasting.
Sales software isn't capable of working by itself as they require data points from various sources.
A good sales software should be able to integrate with other existing software - marketing, contact management, customer success, and more.
Dealing with sensitive and private information with your customers is something that your team is already aware of.
But, ensure that the sales software you pick has the right security to keep all your sensitive data safe and they follow privacy laws such as GDPR, SOC-2, and more.
You do not want your sales representatives spending weeks and months learning one feature of the new software.
This not only reduces productivity but also increases the chances of making human errors.
Select a sales software that is easy to learn, use, and access to make sales management easy!
Some of the key features of a CRM are -
A reputable CRM will help you store all contact information entering your sales funnel such as names, addresses, and social media profiles in a searchable database.
While all CRMs provide contact management functions, look into the layouts and usability to make sense to your business.
A CRM makes the process of managing leads a breeze by identifying, scoring, and moving leads through the sales pipeline.
Set up an easy workflow to automate and streamline the process to make it easy.
CRM software can make your life easier by automating your everyday tasks.
Look for a CRM software that lets you customize your workflows and set up custom rules to help you and your team be more productive.
By automating your workflow, you can minimize the time taken to complete sales tasks such as order processing, sending an email, follow-ups, and more.
No two businesses are the same, so the best CRM software will cater to your business's unique needs.
Select a CRM that offers you customization to tailor the software to your business and lets you choose the features. Some of the areas you can customize are contact fields, reports, data tracking, extensions, coaching, and more.
Connecting your CRM to your existing software can save you a ton of time and money.
Pick a CRM that is compatible with the software you use and is easy to implement.
Also known as customer analytics, this offers insight into customer data.
This data is important to help you make better, data-driven decisions about the types of products, services, marketing, sales, and other types of communication you distribute to your customers.
A CRM software should provide you with real-time analytics and reports to always stay on top of your customers and never let a deal slip away.
A CRM with sales forecasting can accurately predict your future deals based on data from your current pipeline.
Sales forecasting provides you with an analysis to let you know the possibility of converting into a paying customer. It can also anticipate market trends to mitigate business risks.
A CRM tool can help you acquire and retain customers by providing excellent, human-like customer service.
With the help of artificial intelligence, a CRM tool can mimic a human to provide solutions to all customer queries throughout their user journey, saving a ton of time for sales teams.
Sales software helps businesses with several advantages. Here are a few benefits of using a sales software -
Sales software can aid businesses by keeping their customer database intact and organized.
With sales software, sales teams can get an overview of how their prospects behave, including the last contact, their preferences, and details about their interactions with your company.
The best sales software can help you fill your sales pipeline with leads and prioritize the most valuable leads with lead scoring.
This helps your sales team prioritize, stay focused on deals that convert, and, thus, close more deals.
Sales software can also improve collaboration and streamline workflows to improve overall team productivity.
Sales software provides complete access to critical data and insights to make data-driven decisions in favor of your business.
The platform collates all sales-related data, organizes, and analyzes with the leverage of technology to help your team make critical decisions fast, and shift gears accordingly.
The right sales software helps businesses easily forecast sales and other important metrics based on their activities.
These forecasts are not only accurate but also help sales teams prioritize and understand their customers better with the help of data.
In addition, with the aid of customer data, sales teams can easily understand the needs of their customers and discover hidden opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.
The benefits and features of sales software cannot be emphasized enough.
Whether you need help in organizing your team or handling a myriad of product requests you receive from prospects, the right sales software can help you.
If you're looking for the right sales software aided with state-of-the-art technology to help your sales team stay organized and streamline processes, book a demo to explore more.

Customers are the bloodline of any business and the sales team is their backbone.
Finding new customers is key to growth and so is sustaining the ones you already have and building strong relationships with them.
With the right technology, this process can seem like a breeze.
Typically, businesses looking to automate their business processes look at two primary solutions - sales software and customer relationship management (CRM).
While sales software helps sales teams stay organized and streamline their process, a CRM, on the other hand, is to manage all your customer relationships in one place.
But, which one will bring more value to your business, and most importantly, why do you need these types of softwares?
In this blog post, we'll answer your questions. Let's begin.
Sales software is a digital tool that aids businesses stay organized by streamlining their sales operations.
A sales software optimizes, streamlines, and shortens the sales cycle, thus helping sales reps to accelerate the selling of a product and ensuring sales representatives have access to sales tools that help them meet their key sales performance benchmarks.
Sales software can be equivalent to the already existing software from your sales stack to increase the opportunities of acquiring paying customers.
In any business, the process of lead generation alone isn't sufficient - identifying leads that convert is even more important.
This will ultimately enhance the usage of sales resources and increase the chances of conversion to paying customers.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a type of technology to manage your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers.
A CRM system helps businesses stay connected to customers, improve profitability, and enhance relatability to streamline processes.
A CRM solution helps sales representatives focus on your business's relationships with individual people - including vendors, customers, suppliers, and more in a single place - throughout the sales lifecycle including lead generation, providing support, winning their business, and more.
Often, people confuse sales software and a customer relationship management tool.
In fact, the differences are quite striking.
A sales software helps businesses manage every step of the sales cycle right from the first inquiry to the first order, onboarding, payment, and billing.
A CRM software is a digital tool leveraged by businesses to manage their interactions with existing and potential customers.
The CRM software integrates with the marketing platforms to pull the information on leads and lets sales reps initiate a point of contact with potential customers. The CRM also lets sales reps follow up with prospects until they are pushed to the final stage of the sales process.
At this stage, sales software helps sales representatives manage their sales cycle in every stage. Then, the CRM continues the interaction with customers via regular communication channels.
Some of the key features of a sales software are -
Sales software provides sales representatives with information about overall revenue, conversion rates, length of the sales cycle, team performance, and more data.
This data can provide an overview of the overall health of the business and track it too.
Accessing sales reports, regardless of their timeline, with sales software has never been easier.
Track past and current sales accounts and easily reconcile them for sales representatives and stay on top of those deals!
A sales software should be able to manage and streamline every customer interaction, including onboarding, payment, and billing easily.
A vital capability of software sales is to manage and update inventory as and when products are being sold.
This can help sales representatives stay ahead of the demand and reduce shortage costs.
Sales teams are way more effective when they understand how likely a lead is going to convert.
With the leverage of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, sales representatives can easily focus on the leads that have high chances of converting.
In addition, with the help of data intelligence, businesses can rely on software sales to receive accurate sales forecasting.
Sales software isn't capable of working by itself as they require data points from various sources.
A good sales software should be able to integrate with other existing software - marketing, contact management, customer success, and more.
Dealing with sensitive and private information with your customers is something that your team is already aware of.
But, ensure that the sales software you pick has the right security to keep all your sensitive data safe and they follow privacy laws such as GDPR, SOC-2, and more.
You do not want your sales representatives spending weeks and months learning one feature of the new software.
This not only reduces productivity but also increases the chances of making human errors.
Select a sales software that is easy to learn, use, and access to make sales management easy!
Some of the key features of a CRM are -
A reputable CRM will help you store all contact information entering your sales funnel such as names, addresses, and social media profiles in a searchable database.
While all CRMs provide contact management functions, look into the layouts and usability to make sense to your business.
A CRM makes the process of managing leads a breeze by identifying, scoring, and moving leads through the sales pipeline.
Set up an easy workflow to automate and streamline the process to make it easy.
CRM software can make your life easier by automating your everyday tasks.
Look for a CRM software that lets you customize your workflows and set up custom rules to help you and your team be more productive.
By automating your workflow, you can minimize the time taken to complete sales tasks such as order processing, sending an email, follow-ups, and more.
No two businesses are the same, so the best CRM software will cater to your business's unique needs.
Select a CRM that offers you customization to tailor the software to your business and lets you choose the features. Some of the areas you can customize are contact fields, reports, data tracking, extensions, coaching, and more.
Connecting your CRM to your existing software can save you a ton of time and money.
Pick a CRM that is compatible with the software you use and is easy to implement.
Also known as customer analytics, this offers insight into customer data.
This data is important to help you make better, data-driven decisions about the types of products, services, marketing, sales, and other types of communication you distribute to your customers.
A CRM software should provide you with real-time analytics and reports to always stay on top of your customers and never let a deal slip away.
A CRM with sales forecasting can accurately predict your future deals based on data from your current pipeline.
Sales forecasting provides you with an analysis to let you know the possibility of converting into a paying customer. It can also anticipate market trends to mitigate business risks.
A CRM tool can help you acquire and retain customers by providing excellent, human-like customer service.
With the help of artificial intelligence, a CRM tool can mimic a human to provide solutions to all customer queries throughout their user journey, saving a ton of time for sales teams.
Sales software helps businesses with several advantages. Here are a few benefits of using a sales software -
Sales software can aid businesses by keeping their customer database intact and organized.
With sales software, sales teams can get an overview of how their prospects behave, including the last contact, their preferences, and details about their interactions with your company.
The best sales software can help you fill your sales pipeline with leads and prioritize the most valuable leads with lead scoring.
This helps your sales team prioritize, stay focused on deals that convert, and, thus, close more deals.
Sales software can also improve collaboration and streamline workflows to improve overall team productivity.
Sales software provides complete access to critical data and insights to make data-driven decisions in favor of your business.
The platform collates all sales-related data, organizes, and analyzes with the leverage of technology to help your team make critical decisions fast, and shift gears accordingly.
The right sales software helps businesses easily forecast sales and other important metrics based on their activities.
These forecasts are not only accurate but also help sales teams prioritize and understand their customers better with the help of data.
In addition, with the aid of customer data, sales teams can easily understand the needs of their customers and discover hidden opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.
The benefits and features of sales software cannot be emphasized enough.
Whether you need help in organizing your team or handling a myriad of product requests you receive from prospects, the right sales software can help you.

Every business should focus on building a data-driven sales growth strategy. That means, before you build a new set of sales strategies, make sure that your existing sales strategies are driving you some results.
Now the question is, how can you measure your sales performance? Well, the best way to do that is by tracking some of the key sales growth metrics. These metrics will help you gain actionable insights into your sales performance. And accordingly, you can build a personalized sales strategy for your brand.
This article will help you identify the sales metrics you must track along with some of the best sales growth strategies.
So, let’s begin!
Here is a list of five sales growth metrics that will help you identify your organization’s financial health so that you can adjust your sales growth strategies accordingly.
The purpose of measuring this KPI is to find out how much an organization’s overall sales have increased in a particular period. Sales growth is closely related to an organization’s financial growth. So, measuring these sales metrics is imperative. The sales growth rate formula is as follows:
Sales growth rate = [ Current period’s sales - Previous period’s sales ] / Sales Growth Rate
A positive sales growth rate value is always desirable for organizations. It would mean that your sales are growing and so is your organization. On the other hand, a negative sales growth rate indicates that your business needs quick strategy changes to increase the sales growth rate.
CAC is another major sales growth KPI that you should track. It includes all the costs a business might need to incur when acquiring a new customer. These could mean any type of cost starting from rep’s salaries, sales incentives, marketing expenses, sales software subscription charges, and so on. A business that can acquire more customers while cutting down its CAC value is ideally going in the right direction.
Another sales performance indicator that you must be aware of is CLV. It indicates the overall revenue an organization should expect from a single customer throughout their association with the business. If you can regularly track this KPI and put effort into improving it, it will help you create loyal customers and open doors to boost overall revenue.
For SaaS businesses, measuring customer churn rate is mandatory. This sales growth metric indicates the number of customers who have stopped using your products or services in a particular period. This KPI can provide you with practical insights on how effective your retention and sales growth strategies are. Therefore, you can easily understand what strategic changes you need to perform.
Your sales pipeline can be filled with lots of leads, but you need to track how many of those are actually getting converted. Generating leads is pointless unless you can convert them. By measuring this, you’ll get an idea of how good your current lead conversion strategies are. It also determines how interested the prospects are in being your paid customers.
Once you track down the above sales growth KPIs and find your improvement areas, it’s time to use these datasets to improve your sales growth. Here are a few tactics to grow your sales:
The first step to building a data-driven sales growth strategy is using a sales enablement tool like SalesKen. Such a tool can help you drive comprehensive insights into your sales activities and help your reps identify the improvement areas. SalesKen’s sales enablement software can help you with the following:
Planning your sales growth strategies? The first question you should ask yourself is, do the reps know your products inside out? When a prospect asks why they should buy your products, can they answer it properly?
The key to sales growth is ensuring that your reps are thoroughly aware of the products they are selling. That way, they can understand the prospect’s pain points and pitch the right solutions at the right place. Brands can also arrange special product tutorials for the reps to grow their product expertise.
A deep level of product knowledge can help the reps to answer any questions from the prospects. Product expertise can help you build a unique selling proposition for your brand and help you gain long-term success.
Finally, the best way to achieve sales growth is by measuring sales performance regularly. Apart from tracking the major sales metrics, you can also use SalesKen’s sales performance tool to get the latest updates in your brand’s sales activities. Here’s how this tool can help you:
We hope you have a significant understanding of sales growth and different sales performance metrics. Apply our recommended sales growth strategies, and you’re bound to observe major changes.

Pricing a B2B (Business to Business) product can be overwhelming, largely because B2B organizations need to consider all selling characteristics before pricing.
The pricing strategy should reflect all the hard work the internal team has put in to develop a compelling product.
Here is a comprehensive guide on B2B pricing strategies to help you pick the best one for your business.
B2B pricing is fixing various B2B product and/or service prices depending on the overall cost and effort involved. For example, if a business is selling project management software to another business, the following factors will be considered:
Different B2B businesses use pricing models and strategies to establish pricing for their products and services.
An appropriate B2B sales pricing strategy can make or break a business's overall revenue. 90% of startups fail, and many times, it is because of a weak pricing strategy. Companies often focus on process automation, lead generation, and deliverables but a strong pricing strategy should
Pricing is complicated and requires the involvement of multiple departments. As a result, pricing often becomes a secondary factor for organizations. However, finding and implementing an optimized pricing strategy can drive businesses towards exponential growth.
B2B pricing model is the structure that businesses follow to decide how to charge the users for different products and services. Here is a list of the most popular pricing models for B2B professionals:
Value-based pricing is when a brand prices its products based on its understanding of the customers’ needs and requirements. Under this pricing model, the B2B decision-makers try to perceive the worth of a product from the end-users’ point of view.
This pricing model is dependent on marketing initiatives. Largely because brands implement various marketing tactics to seek end users’ attention. To successfully implement value-based pricing, businesses should put strong effort in market research, survey, collecting customer feedback, etc.
A popular B2B SaaS brand that offers value-based pricing is Trello.

The above image shows how Trello uses a value-based or freemium pricing model. Starting from the free plan to the Enterprise plan, Trello keeps adding several features and integrations. Accordingly, the price also increases.
Pros
Cons
A popular pricing model for B2B organizations is to charge based on the number of users. The price range varies depending on the increase or decrease in users. For example, an instant messaging service may charge a certain amount for the first 100 users, and the price also increases as the number of users crosses 100.
Mailchimp has adopted a user-based pricing framework. As the below image shows, this email marketing software increases its charges as you increase the number of contacts. Currently, it shows pricing for 1500 contacts. As the total number of contacts increases, the pricing will also increase.

Pros
Cons
The dynamic pricing model works best for large enterprises residing in multiple locations. Pricing depends on numerous factors like currency, customers’ requirements, purchasing power, etc. Hence, if a business operates in various locations, it is mandatory to consider these factors for fixing the prices of different locations.
Leading eCommerce giant Amazon follows a dynamic pricing strategy across the globe. To successfully implement this strategy, Amazon collects huge amounts of data regularly and analyzes competitors’ pricing models and other transactional data for each customer.
Businesses should note that dynamic pricing is not about changing pricing for each business division. It is about segmenting each business division into various categories and fixing the prices accordingly.
Pros
Cons
Competitor-based pricing strategy is about fixing prices based on competitors’ pricing strategies. An organization needs to estimate an average price for all its competitors to implement this pricing model.
Afterward, the brand can decide whether they want to keep the same price or go slightly higher or lower the average price. The concept of this pricing model is that you are letting your competitors do all the hard work and hoping that their pricing strategy is right.
Pros
Cons
A flat-rate price is when a business charges a single price for all its products and services. It is a one-size-fits-all pricing model. Many SaaS brands adopt this strategy, and they charge their customers the same every month, regardless of the number of users or usage limit.
Remote working tool Basecamp uses a flat-rate pricing strategy. As you can see in the below image, Basecamp has only one plan, Basecamp Business, and it charges all customers $99.

Now that you have a brief idea of different B2B pricing strategies and models, let’s highlight some of these mistakes:
Pricing strategy can never be constant. The key to success for any business is consistently experimenting with their pricing strategy and upgrading it as per changing marketing trends. However, some companies prefer one-time research and hardly keep up with the changing market trends. That’s a critical pricing mistake and can lead to huge revenue loss.
Ideally, businesses should appoint dedicated market researchers to conduct customer surveys, evaluate competitors’ pricing strategies and conduct A/B testing to optimize their pricing strategy. This continuous experiment helps them to ensure that the pricing strategy is not becoming stale over time.
Identifying a pricing strategy is difficult if you don’t know your target buyers. Businesses that move on to create a pricing strategy without creating an ideal customer profile make a significant mistake.
An ideal pricing strategy should be customer-centric. You need to know the prospects' financial status, purchasing power, and, most importantly, how much they are willing to pay for your product. When a brand has all this data, it becomes easier to develop a pricing strategy.
Early-stage startups often provide too many discounts to the customers. While they perceive this as a retention strategy, it can always go the other way. Customers may believe that the product is of poor quality, which can drive them away. Occasional discounts are fine as long as customers are interested in your products and want to invest in them.
Selecting a significant pricing strategy is the first step toward growth. Apart from evaluating the pricing models mentioned above, businesses should also focus on finding a sales enablement tool that provides real-time insights into customers’ behavioral patterns. That way, sales reps, and marketers can identify what price the customers are willing to pay.
When we say sales enablement, the first tool that crosses our mind is - Salesken. On a mission to improve your sales strategy, this B2B SaaS tool helps sales managers and reps with the following:

SaaS pricing is a unique pricing model where customers pay based on subscriptions. The factors that decide SaaS pricing include target customers’ needs, brand revenue goals and software usage.
Without a straightforward pricing strategy, target customers can confuse and select your competitors over you. B2B pricing helps businesses to add transparency to their operations and attract customers easily.
There is no hard and fast rule to set up your B2B pricing strategy. Businesses must evaluate various B2B pricing models to select a suitable strategy. Some quick tips for selecting a B2B pricing strategy are as follows:

A price objection is the most common objection surfaced in every sales call - 1 in 4 prospects raise objections regarding price. And the Pavlovian.response is to offer a discount or monetary incentive.
But is it really effective?
At Salesken.ai we have the benefit of assisting and analyzing almost 1 million minutes of sales conversations every month. Our customers include companies in Education, Software, and the Financial Services industries. And their buyers are both businesses and consumers.
Our data shows that top reps offer a price discount in only 5% of their successful calls. So how do they address price objections in the rest of the calls?
The LAVA is an effective Objection Handling Technique. Once you have listened to and acknowledged the prospects' concerns, Verify. Probe further to verify the true concern of the prospect. Based on the prospects’ response, you can classify them into one of these 4 personas:
You need to tailor your responses to each of the personas.
Ask yourself this question - Why does a customer purchase a product? Is it for the features or the value it offers? A Kindle is a library of thousands of books but does a frequent traveler need thousands of books. What Kindle does is, it gives one the option to read from a wide range of books without having to physically carry them. People purchase kindle not because it can store thousands of books (feature) but because it can save them luggage space (value).
‍ So when a prospect questions how the product can help them, do not state the features, but the value - how it can save time, money, and resources. How being a part of a global community of users can add value to their business, their networks, and help in building their business brand. Sell the shade, not the branch.
A prospect may see the value in the offering but may be reluctant to spend the time and resources to solve it at present. This is more relevant in 2020 than ever before with almost everyone dealing with an economic downturn and a global health crisis.
Show them the high cost of doing nothing -missed $$$ in earnings or savings (both time and resources). Quantifying the cost of the status quo gets the prospect to prioritizing change.
These prospects are wary of getting into a long term contract. It could be an external reason (uncertain economic prospects and others) or specific to you and your product (the prospect may not trust you enough to get into a contract).
In this scenario, look for workarounds - monthly or quarterly subscriptions, pay-as-you-go, and other options. This will allow them to try the solution on offer and see for themselves how your offering can add value to them.
It is quite possible that the prospect may actually not have the money. Before responding, confirm if they see the value in your offering - do they have a need for it, and is it a priority for them now?. Once you are sure they see value in your product - show them the money.
Show them how your product can help in saving money for them. If you have a basic version with limited features- sign them up for it. Offer structured discounts - half price for a limited time, a trial period for a limited number of users, and others.
Often, prospects are reluctant to convey their real concerns and use Price Objections as a smoke screen to end the engagement. And as sales reps, the onus is on you to unearth the actual concerns. So the next time you face a price objection, probe further, verify the real concern of the prospect and respond accordingly!

Often, prospects are reluctant to convey their real concerns and use Price Objections as a smoke screen to end the engagement. And as sales reps, the onus is on you to unearth the actual concerns. So the next time you face a price objection, probe further, verify the real concern of the prospect and respond accordingly!

A B2B sales email is an intuitively structured message sent to different B2B decision-makers, and stakeholders through automation or manual process. Sales representatives send these sales emails or cold emails to their prospects with the motive to nurture them as leads and pitch the offers.
While the lead generation process is evolving and sales reps are making the most of emerging channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc., email remains a top favorite. HubSpot shows that B2B sales emails have the potential to generate up to 4200% of ROI.
However, crafting cold emails is not easy. In fact, the average response rate on cold emails is 1%. Want to know the secrets to writing cold emails that stand out? You must write a compelling subject line, an exciting copy, and place a persuasive CTA.
Want to know how to do that? Let us help you in this detailed B2B sales email guide.
Writing a cold email that converts is tricky. However, a few quick tricks and strategies can simplify your job. Here are a few tried and tested tips to write sales emails that are informative, personalized and don’t sound like you are selling:
Your cold email's subject line creates the first impression for the target B2B audiences. To engage the B2B decision-makers, sales reps should do regular A/B tests with the subject lines. The subject lines have to be exciting without sounding like spam.
Now the question is how to write such attractive and credible subject lines.
These tips might help.
Here is a subject line from Grammarly that we found impressive:
Source
Here’s why:
306 billions emails are sent every day as of 2021, and only 19.8% of these emails are opened. If you cannot craft a B2B cold email that is personalized and authentic, your target audiences may never even open it.
B2B decision-makers are busy and don’t read each and every cold email coming their way. However, a concise email communicating the messaging can easily draw their attention. Hence, the goal of a sales rep should be to write brief and informative sales emails.
Before drafting an email straight away, ask these questions yourself:
Keep these two pointers in mind and remove anything that sounds excessive concerning the context.
Here are a few tips to write short and readable cold emails:
Check this example of a short and crisp cold email:
Source
This email stands out because it is direct and the author doesn’t use any fluff. She has directly explained how she found out about Zach (the prospect), what more information she collected about him, and how she can help the prospect.
After you write a great email, you must conclude it well. The best way to conclude a B2B cold email is by adding the correct Call-to-Action (CTA). The CTA is what verifies your claims mentioned in the mail body and directs the users to a compelling offer that they cannot resist.
Can you add an urgency factor to the CTA? That’s even better. It will help the fear of missing out on a great offer and they will take action quickly. A CTA can be as simple as “Book a demo” or as complicated as “Please reply with your complaint”. As long as it is relevant to the email content and not pushy, it can help you draw the audience’s attention.
A great way to spice up the CTA is by merging with social proof or a past success story. For example:
“Read our case study to see how we doubled the retention rate of Brand X”.
“We have a combined social media following of 50K on LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram. Join the Tribe”.
Such statistically sound CTAs are easily relatable and compelling at the same time. They can easily engage the target audiences and convince them to click on the offer.
We hope the tips we included in the previous section can accelerate your cold email outreach efforts. We are going a step further and helping you with some B2B sales email templates and examples to help you out.
AIDA or Attention-Interest-Desire-Action is one of the oldest principles of cold email and it still works. The AIDA framework states that a B2B cold email should have:
Here is a cold email template that follows the AIDA formula:
Hi [First name], If you are a [the designation of the prospect], you already know how hard it is to [explain a problem they are facing]. We can help you. Our product [name of product/solution] has helped X no. of customers to [the problem it solved] by [the solution]. Here’s how we helped Brand Y - [Attach a case study] Would you like to discuss this? Let me know the best time to call you this week. Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
The SAS formula introduces a unique approach to cold email outreach. It suggests that:
The SAS formula uses storytelling to entertain and educate the prospects simultaneously.
Here’s an email template that follows the SAS framework:
Hi [First name], [Star] was facing a critical issue in the first half of 2020. The brand was [Explain the challenge]. In this situation, [Star] needed to achieve [result to win], but [Arch/ Cause of the challenge] made it impossible. So how did [Star] fight back? Would you like to discuss this? Let me know the best time to call you this week.[Star] used [your product/solution name] and [how it helped]. We have helped X companies to win with our cutting-edge solution [Name]. If interested, I can send you a personalized template to solve this challenge. Let me know when you are free to discuss this. Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
The PAS framework is a good old method to develop the content of any sort. It works well for B2B cold emails too. This framework states that an email should:
Use this template to apply PAS formula in your cold emails:
Hi [First name], Are you facing [explain the problem]? Many of your competitors like [mention a few names] have faced this challenge. It is a critical problem and can lead to [mention some critical consequences]. Our [product/solution] has helped Company X to solve this challenge. Read how in this case study - [Link to case study] I would love to understand the challenges you are facing. Can we connect next week to discuss this? Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
Does your prospect know about you? An introductory cold email is very important in any cold email sequence. It helps you establish credibility and helps the prospects to clear their doubts about your organization.
Here is a template that you can use for this purpose:
Hi [First name], I am [Your name] working as a [designation] at [Company name]. I recently came across your website while researching for [one of the competitor’s names of the prospect]. After spending a few minutes on your website and exploring how you approach solving [a pain point of the prospect that your product can solve], I identified an opportunity. We have helped [competitor’s name] to solve [the problem] and achieve [ the results]. See what they say about us here - [Attach a testimonial]. Do you have sometime to discuss this next week? Let me know, I will share a meeting link. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
B2B selling is challenging at times. Mostly because multiple stakeholders are involved in each stage of the selling process. It is often difficult for the sales reps to reach out to the key decision-maker. Here is a B2B cold email template to help you identify the key decision-maker quickly:
Hi [First name], Quick question: Who is heading your company's [Name of relevant department]? They will surely want to know how we at [your company name] helped Company X [competitor’s name] to achieve [results you achieved] with our product [product name]. If you are the right person to discuss this further, let me know when we can connect next week for a quick discussion. Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
Want to create a long-lasting impression for your leads? Show them how you are better than your competitors. Here is a B2B cold email template that can be handy:
Hi [First name], I was browsing your website and found that you are using [competitor’s solution name]. How is this product performing for you? I work in [your company name], and we have a similar product called [product name]. Only our product can [ mention the key differentiator], and we think this can help [prospect’s company name]. Let’s get in a quick call to discuss this further. Are you free anytime next week? Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
Not following up is the biggest mistake. 48% of sales reps don’t follow up even once, which can result in the loss of powerful leads. Here is a follow-up cold email template that you can re-use:
Hi [First name], Hope you are doing well. We had discussed helping you solve [mention the problems] with [your product name] to achieve [results to expect]. But I didn’t get a chance to finalize things yet. I would love to hop on a quick call to discuss this further. Will you be free sometime next week? Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thanks, [Sales rep’s name]
Now that you know how to write B2B cold emails, here are a few things that you must NOT do while writing and sending cold emails:
A generic subject line that doesn’t target the right group of prospects may not create a good impression. Keep your email subject line short, personalized and maintain a professional tone. The subject line has to be relevant. It must explain what to expect from the email. Don’t write irrelevant subject lines just because they are attention-grabbing.
Sending follow-up emails is always a good idea. However, sending multiple follow-up cold sales emails can send you to the cursed SPAM folder. Sending too many emails is pushing the prospects to speak with you. That is not a good idea as it may force the prospects to question your credibility.
B2B decision-makers are busy and no way they will read lengthy emails. Remove anything that’s unnecessary and keep it short. Make sure that your cold email is brief and it communicates the messaging efficiently.
Don’t use fancy words and jargon in cold emails. Keep the email copy simple and easy to comprehend. Else, the prospect will delete it after reading the very first line. Also, avoid fillers and keep each sentence unique.
Is your cold email all about your brand, success, and achievements? Celebrating your brand too much can also push you to the prospects’ SPAM folder. The email content should be mostly about the prospects, their challenges, and what solution you can provide them.
B2B sales process is challenging and so is drafting personalized B2B sales emails. What if we tell you about a B2B sales tool that can help you write better sales emails?

Every B2B business has one common goal - generating more sales qualified leads and converting them to paid customers. However, the B2B business industry is filled with cutthroat competition, and generating leads is not always enough. The focus should be rather on generating high-quality B2B sales leads.
Generating high-quality sales leads can be tricky. Businesses need a set of targeted outbound strategies and lead generation tools to achieve that.
If you plan to fill your sales pipeline with high-quality leads, this comprehensive guide will help you. This guide will shortlist some of the easiest strategies to generate B2B sales leads for your business.
A B2B sales lead is a person or organization that matches your target buyer persona. B2B lead generation process begins with identifying potential customers, and it goes on through several other steps till conversion.
Creating an ideal buyer persona is vital for the B2B lead generation process. A specific and in-depth buyer profile can help the sales reps understand their target audience and ensure more high-intent leads.
Every B2B sales lead is different from the other and requires a different approach for conversion. Even though some leads show interest in an organization’s products and services, it is not always possible to convert them into buyers for numerous reasons.
However, the goal of any B2B organization should be to attract more and more high-quality leads and put their best step forward to convert them. For that, businesses need a powerful B2B lead generation process.
The B2B lead generation process includes several steps like collecting information about potential customers and making the most of this information to develop a personalized sales pitch. However, this is the fundamental method of B2B lead generation.
With each passing day, the B2B landscape is changing, and accordingly, the B2B lead generation process is also reaching new heights. 70% of B2B buyers feel that relevant content is very important in purchase decision-making.
In fact, some of the key factors in selecting a B2B vendor include strong knowledge of the industry, targeted content, and reviews from industry peers.
Contrary to the traditional lead generation process, majorities of B2B sales leads originate from SEO (14%), email marketing (13%), and social media (12%), as per HubSpot. This establishes that organizations need a dedicated process to generate more B2B sales leads.
If you plan to generate valuable B2B sales leads, you must develop an efficient lead generation process. Here are a few steps that can help you build a B2B sales pipeline with valuable leads:
The first step of any B2B lead generation process is to collect information about your potential buyers. In this step, sales reps can navigate various company websites, emails, social media, and other channels to search for the ideal buyer persona. Once they have a list of potential buyers, they can use Leadfeeder, Lusha, etc., to extract the contact information.
Once the sales reps have a list of high-quality leads in place, the next step is to start outreaching. Sales professionals can reach out to the B2B sales leads through emails, social media, calls, and cold outreach. However, before starting a cold outreach campaign, research the potential buyers and their pain points. This will help sales reps understand what the buyers are looking for and craft their sales pitches accordingly.
This is by far the most difficult B2B lead generation process. This step aims to interact with the leads and pursue them through relationship-building.
The three integral aspects of this step are as follows:
If a lead reaches this stage, it is safe to say that they are converted into a paid customer, and the sales reps are about to close the deal. The customer success team takes over and starts the client onboarding process as a next step.
One of the biggest dilemmas sales professionals face is - prioritizing between quality and quantity when it comes to B2B sales leads. B2B sales reps should start with differentiating between these two factors and then make a decision:
Quantity is an essential factor in deciding the scalability level for sales teams. A business may generate 10 sales leads every day, but not all 10 of those will convert into customers. For example, for the B2B SaaS industry, the average lead conversion rate is only 7%. This has led to the belief that B2B organizations should generate many leads every day to maintain a full sales pipeline.
While quantity matters in B2B sales, it is not ultimate. In fact, it is always better to generate 1 high-quality lead instead of 10 poor-quality leads in the long run. The average lead conversion rate is already very low for B2B sales. On the contrary, B2B sales cycles are long, and the process is complex. Therefore, the sales reps should invest their time and energy in qualifying the quality leads with high revenue opportunities.
In fact, if a business focuses on quality B2B sales leads from the beginning, reducing churn becomes simpler. This typically means higher customer satisfaction and a better post-purchase experience.
Generating high-quality sales leads is not as easy as ABC. Sales reps need a set of targeted strategies to generate more valuable leads. Here are a few strategies that worked for us:
Landing pages play a key role in any sales campaign. It is where your leads would land after clicking an ad. Landing pages have the potential to drive conversion and boost sales for businesses. Hence, sales and marketing teams should constantly experiment with the landing page designs to enhance its conversion potential.
Wondering how to run A/B tests on landing pages? Here are a few ways to get started:

Did you know that 9 out of 10 B2B buyers make a purchase decision based on online content? Hence, a critical part of B2B sales leads generation is to develop a targeted and relevant content strategy. Businesses can plan different types of content, including blogs, whitepapers, case studies, datasheets, etc., to educate the potential buyers and build their interest in a particular product/service.
Keep the following aspects in mind while crafting a B2B content strategy:
Source
Lead magnets are a bridge between B2B sales leads and a sales team. A lead magnet is a value-packed, downloadable resource that you can offer your target audiences in exchange for their contact details. A targeted lead magnet should solve the pain points your buyers are facing.
Many B2B organizations are yet to figure out the true purpose of a lead magnet. Instead of offering tailored, brand-specific information, businesses end up offering generic lead magnets with information already available in the market.
Some of the tried and tested ideas for B2B lead magnet include:
B2B sales process is complicated as there are multiple stakeholders at each touchpoint and the long sales cycle. Each of these stakeholders has its requirements, and the sales reps should be aware of multiple aspects to answer their queries.
However, it is almost impossible for an individual sales rep to keep up with prospects’ expectations. That’s why B2B sales teams need speech analytics software like Salesken. Here’s how it can help the sales reps:

A critical part of any sales representative’s job is to make cold calls. Cold calling is still not out of the trend. In fact, 51% of buyers prefer to be contacted by phone. Hence, along with the new forms of sales outreach like social selling, and email marketing, cold calling continues to be a top preference for B2B buyers.
Here are a few easy tips to make cold calls like a pro:
Social selling is slowly becoming the next big thing in B2B sales. Hence, B2B sales professionals should not stick to a single social platform to reach their target audiences. Try different platforms and adopt different approaches to connect with your target audiences.
Hence, along with conventional social channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, B2B sales teams should also explore newer platforms like Reddit, Pinterest, Quora, Snapchat, Clubhouse, and TikTok, which are gaining a lot of momentum lately.

B2B stands for Business-to-business. It simply focuses on businesses that sell products and services to other businesses.

Suppose you are starting your B2B sales journey.
What are the essential factors that you will need at the very beginning?
Most startup founders often struggle with the third.
An ideal B2B sales team structure should comprise a group of go-getters who can make the most of each sales opportunity coming their way.
As a founder of a sales manager, you cannot just hire any sales rep and expect prompt lead generation. You must spend significant time identifying the right sales team structure matching your vision.
In this guide, we’ll help you identify the best B2B sales team structure for your organization so that you can achieve your sales goals.
There are three sales team structures that B2B organizations can implement. Find out more about these in this section and identify which structure fits your team:
The island sales team structure is a traditional framework when sales are forced to fulfill their sales quota at any cost. The organizational structure behind this model is fundamental. Organizations following the island structure believe in appointing one sales owner responsible for managing a team of sales reps.
Under the island structure, each sales rep is responsible for different sales process steps, from lead generation to lead conversion. As a result, the sales reps become highly competitive and fail to collaborate with other sales reps within the internal team.
If you are running a small business with a 1-2 person sales team, this sales team structure can work for you. For 1-stage, simple sales processes, the island model works the best.
The concept of assembly line structure from Ford’s Model T can be implemented in sales teams. Under this model, you can break down a sales team into the following stages:
The assembly line model believes in segmenting sales teams based on their functions and expertise. It follows the B2B sales funnel and ensures that the customers get proper assistance from the sales professionals along their journey throughout the funnel.
The assembly line sales team structure is perfect for startups. This framework ensures an efficient sales cycle with fewer complexities. This model can help startups to create a repeatable sales process that generates, nurtures, and closes leads with less friction.
Customer-centric organizations prefer the pod sales team structure where the same sales professionals are responsible for different activities. This B2B sales team structure is close to the assembly line model.
Suppose you have a 10-member sales team with three lead generation executives, three SDRs, two AEs, and two customer success managers. Unlike the assembly line model, where all of these team members would work for all customers, the pod structure believes in creating small pods for each customer.
For customer A, there will be one lead generation executive, one SDR, one AE, and one customer success manager. This small pod of experts will specifically work for one particular customer and work hard to derive results.
The pod structure is highly flexible, and the room for success is higher. Because each member working in a particular pod has complete visibility into the product, the possibilities of success are higher.
The pod sales structure extends to the assembly line sales team structure. It is a perfect fit for startups with small sales teams planning to make the most of their existing sales teams.
Are you a new founder struggling to form a B2B sales team? We have some tried and tested tips that can work wonders for you:
The sales team is the first touchpoint for prospects. However, as the lead moves across the sales funnel, they may need to come across other touchpoints like product managers, customer success executives, etc.
This practice ensures complete transparency and helps the prospects clear their doubts about products and processes. Absolute clarity is the key to long-term client retention for brands. Hence, while developing the sales team structure,
Some of the easiest ways to build transparency in your sales team structure are:
Manual efforts can only lead to back-and-forth iterations, frequent mistakes, and eventually burnout. To free up sales reps’ time, sales managers should focus more on using efficient sales tools. Various sales tools like CRM tools, prospecting tools, enablement tools, etc., simplify the sales reps’ responsibilities and encourage them toward the more valuable task - selling.
A powerful tool that can help you form an efficient sales team is - Salesken. Here is how it can help:
To know further, you can book a free demo!
The cornerstone of a successful B2B sales team structure is trust. As a sales leader, your primary goal should be to help the sales reps build sustainable client relationships based on trust, reliability, and value. Sales managers should continue to motivate the sales reps to win prospects’ trust and prioritize their perspectives to create long-lasting impacts.
Building a sales team structure can be challenging. However, sales managers should prioritize building a streamlined sales team structure before expecting the sales team to generate and convert more leads. Businesses can select any sales team structure among island, assembly line, and pod, depending on the number of sales team members and size of the organization. Once the sales team structure is specified, and the sales team members are clear about their responsibilities, there is no coming back!
There’s no one-size-fits-all formula for differentiating between Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) and Business Development Managers (BDMs). However, a tried and tested rule can be to engage the SDRs with lead generation and the BDMs with lead nurturing and conversion activities. Many organizations follow this structure to ensure that SDRs and BDMs become experts in their respective fields and focus on driving higher efficiency in the sales team.

Suppose you are starting your B2B sales journey.
What are the essential factors that you will need at the very beginning?
Most startup founders often struggle with the third.
An ideal B2B sales team structure should comprise a group of go-getters who can make the most of each sales opportunity coming their way.
As a founder of a sales manager, you cannot just hire any sales rep and expect prompt lead generation. You must spend significant time identifying the right sales team structure matching your vision.
In this guide, we’ll help you identify the best B2B sales team structure for your organization so that you can achieve your sales goals.
There are three sales team structures that B2B organizations can implement. Find out more about these in this section and identify which structure fits your team:
The island sales team structure is a traditional framework when sales are forced to fulfill their sales quota at any cost. The organizational structure behind this model is fundamental. Organizations following the island structure believe in appointing one sales owner responsible for managing a team of sales reps.
Under the island structure, each sales rep is responsible for different sales process steps, from lead generation to lead conversion. As a result, the sales reps become highly competitive and fail to collaborate with other sales reps within the internal team.
If you are running a small business with a 1-2 person sales team, this sales team structure can work for you. For 1-stage, simple sales processes, the island model works the best.
The concept of assembly line structure from Ford’s Model T can be implemented in sales teams. Under this model, you can break down a sales team into the following stages:
The assembly line model believes in segmenting sales teams based on their functions and expertise. It follows the B2B sales funnel and ensures that the customers get proper assistance from the sales professionals along their journey throughout the funnel.

Do you have a strong network of B2B sales professionals? Do you have a comprehensive portfolio of successful lead conversion stories? Do you prioritize solving a problem over selling a product?
If the answer to all the above questions is “Yes”, you are eligible to become a B2B sales advisor. Here is a detailed guide on who is a sales advisor, their responsibilities, and the tips to become successful in this profession.
A sales advisor is responsible for ideating, planning, and executing B2B sales strategies for an organization. Generally, sales advisors are not direct employees but work as external advisors or consultants. B2B sales advisors have experienced sales professionals with experience in sales strategy execution.
Some of the critical tasks performed by sales advisors include:
A B2B sales advisor should possess a set of hard and soft skills to engage with prospects and nurture them over a period until they are converted into paid customers. Here is a list of skills that can help sales professionals to become an expert sales advisor:
One of the greatest skills for any B2B sales advisor is communication skills. A sales advisor should master persuasive communication to clearly communicate with prospects and help them understand the product closely. Sales reps should master both written and verbal communication skills to ensure seamless interaction with colleagues, leads, and customers.
B2B sales reps are bound to be involved in different activities like research, cold outreach, networking, and so on. The secret to balance among these activities is effective time management skills. Every rep should be an expert in managing their schedule properly and allocate sufficient time for all activities.
Sales reps should be confident about their public speaking skills. Some of their core activities include arranging product demos and presentations for the prospects to build their interest. Additionally, a tricky part of cold calling is interacting with the prospects when they are least expecting it. Strong public speaking skills can help the reps in handling such situations smartly.
A sales advisor must collaborate with the members of a sales team and the prospects simultaneously. Proper interpersonal skills can help them build professional relationships with both.
Sales advisors need to work with different technical tools like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, automation tools, analytics dashboards, and more. Hence, sales consultants should be well versed with these technical aspects of the sales process.
Nobody can become a sales advisor overnight. It takes several years of practice, upskilling, and experience to become a sensation in the field of B2B sales. Here are a set of tips to help new and experienced sales reps to take the next step in their careers and become a sales advisor:
Prospects don’t want to buy another product unless it solves a real problem. It is part of a sales advisor’s job to highlight how the product they are selling is convenient to solve the prospects’ pain points.
Think of the popular project management tool Trello. When a sales advisor is trying to sell this tool to their prospects, they can base their sales pitch on any one of the following approaches: ‍
‍
The problem-solving approach is more convenient here. Because it doesn’t push the prospects to purchase Trello directly. It rather points out why the prospect should purchase this tool.
To master the problem-solving approach, sales consultants should know the products inside out. If they know the product too well, they can easily associate its features with the target audiences’ pain points. Hence, they can sell the solution instead of the product.
One of the greatest parts of becoming a sales advisor is to create a personal brand. A personal brand helps the sales reps to gain recognition in their target industry and create a long-lasting impact on the prospects.
Here are a few tips to build a strong personal brand as a B2B sales advisor:
A sales advisor should always be honest about their strengths and weaknesses. For example, suppose written communication skill is your strength, and you can easily write convertible cold emails. However, cold calls are not your best skill, and you often struggle with them.
Once you know what your strength is (in this case - email marketing), ask yourself the following questions:
If the answers to these questions are positive, you already have a niche. In their journey of finding a niche, sales professionals should focus on areas they find interesting and have done well in the past. These are more likely to be your ideal niche instead of new areas.
B2B sales advisors should consistently build a network of B2B professionals who are their potential customers. If you are running a small sales consultancy agency and you don’t have a sufficient budget to spend on marketing, networking is the best way out. A strong B2B network can help you connect with your prospects and ensure your sales pipeline is never dry.
A great way to develop your network is by joining relevant LinkedIn groups. You can find several LinkedIn groups relevant to your niche. All you have to do is create content for these groups, and connect with the group members on a personal level to generate and nurture leads.
Creating an offer is one of the most critical steps for any sales advisor. A personalized offer can push the leads toward conversion, whereas a generic offer can push the lead in the opposite direction.
A personalized offer should answer the following questions of the prospect:
All these can help sales advisors build a customized offer tailored to the prospects' requirements.
If you enjoy selling, becoming an independent sales advisor can help you boost your career. Focus on the key skills, past experience, and building relationships with the prospects; you can easily establish yourself as a sales advisor.
Are you still confused about building a career in B2B sales consultancy? Salesken’s sales coaching solution can help you out with:

A great way to develop your network is by joining relevant LinkedIn groups. You can find several LinkedIn groups relevant to your niche. All you have to do is create content for these groups, and connect with the group members on a personal level to generate and nurture leads.
Creating an offer is one of the most critical steps for any sales advisor. A personalized offer can push the leads toward conversion, whereas a generic offer can push the lead in the opposite direction.
A personalized offer should answer the following questions of the prospect:
All these can help sales advisors build a customized offer tailored to the prospects' requirements.
If you enjoy selling, becoming an independent sales advisor can help you boost your career. Focus on the key skills, past experience, and building relationships with the prospects; you can easily establish yourself as a sales advisor.

Closing a sales deal is not as hard as it used to be. With many marketing and promotional channels like social media, emails, websites, etc., marketers and sales reps have numerous ways to sell their products to the right audience.
However, a common challenge that often creates resistance for a sales team is the cutthroat competition. In the Business-to-Business sector, the stakes are higher as the target audiences are founders, CEOs, and CMOs of companies with in-depth knowledge of the industry and its key players. Hence, standing out becomes a challenge.
B2B sales reps must plan innovative strategies to engage the business decision-makers. A great way to decide the upcoming actions of a sales team is by tracking all the key B2B sales metrics.
These metrics can provide a transparent overview of an organization’s sales performance and point out the strong and weak areas. This guide lists all the critical sales metrics B2B sales professionals must track to convert leads into customers.
B2B sales metrics and sales KPIs are two completely different concepts.
Businesses can assess the sales metrics to quantify the various measures and track the progress of different business processes. The primary intention of tracking sales metrics for businesses is to understand how much they spend on their sales activities and to what extent they successfully fulfill their short-term and long-term sales goals.
Sales KPIs on the other hand, help sales managers define and aim for appropriate goals, track progress, and make suitable sales decisions. While both sales metrics and KPIs can influence business decisions, sales KPIs are much more important to defining goals and planning strategies.
Now that the concept of sales metrics and KPIs are clear, here is a list of top B2B sales metrics and KPIs that businesses must track to experience complete visibility:
A Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) is a lead who enters the sales funnel through different actions like clicking on “book a demo,” subscribing to a newsletter, or signing up to download a lead magnet and is further qualified by the marketing team.
Whereas, a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) is a lead who is qualified by sales reps over a discovery call. An SQL is interested in the product/service of the company and is ready to find out more information.
The KPI MQL to SQL shows the effectiveness of the sales reps to qualify the MQLs into prospective customers. For instance, if you get 100 MQLs from the marketing team and only 25 of those leads are further interested in hopping on a call, the MQL to SQL conversion rate will be 25%.
MQL to SQL conversion rate = [ No. of SQLs / No. of MQLs ] * 100%
MQL to SQL conversion rate is a significant KPI for marketing and sales teams. It helps the marketing and sales managers identify whether these two teams collaborate properly and whether their goals are aligned. With this B2B sales metric, marketers and sales professionals can easily see the gaps in their current strategies that can slow down the growth of leads in their sales pipeline.
The next B2B sales metric on our list is sales cycle length. It represents the period for a lead to become a customer. It is one of those B2B sales metrics that help sales teams to strategize new lead nurturing and engagement tricks to reduce the sales cycle length.
Average Sales cycle length = [ No. of days to close deal A + No. of days to close deal B + No. of days to close deal C…] / Total No. of deals
The sales cycle length metric can help sales managers to create accurate sales forecasts, estimate sales efficiency, and identify the improvement areas in existing sales strategies to accelerate the lead conversion process.
This B2B sales KPI helps the sales reps to summarize all the information they have about a prospect. It also points out the status of the leads in the sales pipeline and the sources of these leads.
There is no specific formula for this KPI. Sales reps can use their respective CRM tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, etc., to identify the source of different leads.
This sales KPI helps businesses to target quality leads that are easy to convert and identify channels which have better probability of conversion. For example, suppose majority of your leads are coming through social media. In that case, you can double your efforts into social media organic posting, social media ads, and other innovative activities while minimizing your efforts in other aspects like cold emailing, cold calling, etc.
CAC is a significant B2B sales KPI that helps businesses track how much they spend to acquire each new customer. It depicts the amount a business spends to convert its leads into paid customers.
CAC = [ Cost of sales + Cost of marketing ] / Number of New customers acquired
For any business, it is almost impossible to scale their operations if they don’t have a clear idea of how much they spend acquiring new customers. CAC helps determine whether a business is investing its valuable resources in acquiring customers who are not adding much value in overall profitability.
The win-loss ratio estimates the number of closed deals to the number of lost deals. One of those sales metrics provides the sales managers with closer insights into the current gaps in their sales system and why some sales deals are closed while others are lost. It is a great metric to identify and implement the next steps.
Win-loss ratio = [ No. of leads won / No. of leads lost ]
The win-loss ratio KPI helps sales reps collect sufficient information on the different factors influencing user decision-making. As a result, they have a clear idea of what is working for the users and accordingly, they can match their messaging in line with the brand’s value proposition. Similarly, sales professionals can clearly understand which leads didn’t convert and dig deeper to find the underlying reasons.
Suppose a sales rep has successfully collected a lead’s contact details and sent the first email address. Now what?
As a next step, the sales rep needs to wait till they receive a response from the lead. Lead response time is defined as the time duration a lead requires to respond to a sales rep. The lesser the time, the better. Harvard Business Review says the average lead response time is 42 hours.
Lead response time = [ Time and date of contacting a lead - Time and date when lead responds ]
In B2B sales, every second is important. Sales reps and managers can track this KPI to get an overview of how long the high-quality leads are taking to respond. The lower the lead response time, the better the chances of converting quality prospects. Sales professionals can use this as a scope to evaluate their sales approaches.
To practice active listening, sales teams can use social media, live chat, etc. Leads are often open about their concerns and pain points in these channels. Sales professionals can collect sufficient information through these channels to engage the leads for a long time.
Sales managers require complete visibility into their sales pipeline to identify the revenue potential. Ideally, a sales pipeline must include all sales opportunities, irrespective of the funnel stages they reside in.
The monthly sales pipeline creation KPI encourages a B2B sales team to create the sales pipeline at the beginning of a month. This can help the sales reps to stay informed about the size of the sales pipeline, no. of quality prospects, no. of prospects who are dropping off, and so on.
This is a qualitative B2B sales KPI, and there is no quantifiable formula. However, sales reps can follow the below-mentioned framework to create and maintain B2B sales pipeline consistently every month:
Creating the sales pipeline every month is a great practice for sales reps. It can give the entire sales team a closer look into the number of quality and poor leads in your current sales pipeline. Hence, the sales managers can understand more about the leads that need attention and what would be the best strategies to engage with them.
This B2B sales metric measures the amount of time it takes for sales leads to move across the different sales process stages, from lead generation to conversion. The shorter the value of pipeline velocity, the better. As your sales pipeline velocity increases, the scope of losing prospects along the way also increases. Regular tracking of this metric can help sales teams optimize their existing sales process.
Sales pipeline velocity = [ ( No. of sales opportunities * Value of a sales deal * Win rate) / Length of sales cycle ]
Sales pipeline velocity is one of the most critical B2B sales metrics. It helps sales managers to develop an understanding of how productive the sales team is in converting the leads into paid customers. Sales managers can use this metric to build new sales strategies and forecast sales performance for a particular financial period.
Customer lifetime value estimates the average revenue a business generates from a particular customer throughout their lifetime or engagement with the company. It is a critical sales metric that provides a significant understanding of what is working and what is not for each customer. Sales reps can evaluate this metric to develop new customer retention strategies.
Customer lifetime value = [Total contract value / Average customer lifespan]
CLTV helps B2B professionals to develop long-term insights into the organization’s financial viability. It also identifies which customers are easier to retain. Based on these findings, sales reps can plan new engagement strategies for the existing customers and plan up-sell/cross-sell services to multiply revenue.
Most B2B sales reps are aware of the fact that all leads don’t convert into sales. Hence, for utmost transparency, businesses need to know about the sources for each lead and the revenue associated with that lead. Therefore, revenue by the lead source is a critical KPI that keeps track of all lead sources like social media, emails, websites, etc. and the associated revenue.
Revenue by lead source = Total revenue generated from all the leads acquired by each lead source
Let’s explain the importance of this sales KPI with an example. Suppose LinkedIn is a critical source of lead generation for your business. In fact, the business acquires a high percentage of revenue from this source. In comparison, revenue generated through Twitter and Instagram is much lower for the same business.
At this point, the actionable step for the business is to investigate the other channels and identify whether it should continue to invest in them or allocate the budgets of these channels to LinkedIn. The revenue by lead source can help the business in making these decisions.
We hope sales reps and sales managers now have a comprehensive idea of the top B2B sales metrics and why they should track these KPIs and sales metrics to improve their sales performance.
On this note, we want to suggest Salesken, a powerful sales analytics tool that helps sales managers to:

The KPI MQL to SQL shows the effectiveness of the sales reps to qualify the MQLs into prospective customers. For instance, if you get 100 MQLs from the marketing team and only 25 of those leads are further interested in hopping on a call, the MQL to SQL conversion rate will be 25%.
MQL to SQL conversion rate = [ No. of SQLs / No. of MQLs ] * 100%
MQL to SQL conversion rate is a significant KPI for marketing and sales teams. It helps the marketing and sales managers identify whether these two teams collaborate properly and whether their goals are aligned. With this B2B sales metric, marketers and sales professionals can easily see the gaps in their current strategies that can slow down the growth of leads in their sales pipeline.
The next B2B sales metric on our list is sales cycle length. It represents the period for a lead to become a customer. It is one of those B2B sales metrics that help sales teams to strategize new lead nurturing and engagement tricks to reduce the sales cycle length.
Average Sales cycle length = [ No. of days to close deal A + No. of days to close deal B + No. of days to close deal C…] / Total No. of deals
The sales cycle length metric can help sales managers to create accurate sales forecasts, estimate sales efficiency, and identify the improvement areas in existing sales strategies to accelerate the lead conversion process.
This B2B sales KPI helps the sales reps to summarize all the information they have about a prospect. It also points out the status of the leads in the sales pipeline and the sources of these leads.
There is no specific formula for this KPI. Sales reps can use their respective CRM tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, etc., to identify the source of different leads.
This sales KPI helps businesses to target quality leads that are easy to convert and identify channels which have better probability of conversion. For example, suppose majority of your leads are coming through social media. In that case, you can double your efforts into social media organic posting, social media ads, and other innovative activities while minimizing your efforts in other aspects like cold emailing, cold calling, etc.
CAC is a significant B2B sales KPI that helps businesses track how much they spend to acquire each new customer. It depicts the amount a business spends to convert its leads into paid customers.
CAC = [ Cost of sales + Cost of marketing ] / Number of New customers acquired
For any business, it is almost impossible to scale their operations if they don’t have a clear idea of how much they spend acquiring new customers. CAC helps determine whether a business is investing its valuable resources in acquiring customers who are not adding much value in overall profitability.
The win-loss ratio estimates the number of closed deals to the number of lost deals. One of those sales metrics provides the sales managers with closer insights into the current gaps in their sales system and why some sales deals are closed while others are lost. It is a great metric to identify and implement the next steps.
Win-loss ratio = [ No. of leads won / No. of leads lost ]
The win-loss ratio KPI helps sales reps collect sufficient information on the different factors influencing user decision-making. As a result, they have a clear idea of what is working for the users and accordingly, they can match their messaging in line with the brand’s value proposition. Similarly, sales professionals can clearly understand which leads didn’t convert and dig deeper to find the underlying reasons.
Suppose a sales rep has successfully collected a lead’s contact details and sent the first email address. Now what?
As a next step, the sales rep needs to wait till they receive a response from the lead. Lead response time is defined as the time duration a lead requires to respond to a sales rep. The lesser the time, the better. Harvard Business Review says the average lead response time is 42 hours.
Lead response time = [ Time and date of contacting a lead - Time and date when lead responds ]
In B2B sales, every second is important. Sales reps and managers can track this KPI to get an overview of how long the high-quality leads are taking to respond. The lower the lead response time, the better the chances of converting quality prospects. Sales professionals can use this as a scope to evaluate their sales approaches.
To practice active listening, sales teams can use social media, live chat, etc. Leads are often open about their concerns and pain points in these channels. Sales professionals can collect sufficient information through these channels to engage the leads for a long time.
Sales managers require complete visibility into their sales pipeline to identify the revenue potential. Ideally, a sales pipeline must include all sales opportunities, irrespective of the funnel stages they reside in.
The monthly sales pipeline creation KPI encourages a B2B sales team to create the sales pipeline at the beginning of a month. This can help the sales reps to stay informed about the size of the sales pipeline, no. of quality prospects, no. of prospects who are dropping off, and so on.
This is a qualitative B2B sales KPI, and there is no quantifiable formula. However, sales reps can follow the below-mentioned framework to create and maintain B2B sales pipeline consistently every month:
Creating the sales pipeline every month is a great practice for sales reps. It can give the entire sales team a closer look into the number of quality and poor leads in your current sales pipeline. Hence, the sales managers can understand more about the leads that need attention and what would be the best strategies to engage with them.
This B2B sales metric measures the amount of time it takes for sales leads to move across the different sales process stages, from lead generation to conversion. The shorter the value of pipeline velocity, the better. As your sales pipeline velocity increases, the scope of losing prospects along the way also increases. Regular tracking of this metric can help sales teams optimize their existing sales process.
Sales pipeline velocity = [ ( No. of sales opportunities * Value of a sales deal * Win rate) / Length of sales cycle ]
Sales pipeline velocity is one of the most critical B2B sales metrics. It helps sales managers to develop an understanding of how productive the sales team is in converting the leads into paid customers. Sales managers can use this metric to build new sales strategies and forecast sales performance for a particular financial period.
Customer lifetime value estimates the average revenue a business generates from a particular customer throughout their lifetime or engagement with the company. It is a critical sales metric that provides a significant understanding of what is working and what is not for each customer. Sales reps can evaluate this metric to develop new customer retention strategies.
Customer lifetime value = [Total contract value / Average customer lifespan]
CLTV helps B2B professionals to develop long-term insights into the organization’s financial viability. It also identifies which customers are easier to retain. Based on these findings, sales reps can plan new engagement strategies for the existing customers and plan up-sell/cross-sell services to multiply revenue.
Most B2B sales reps are aware of the fact that all leads don’t convert into sales. Hence, for utmost transparency, businesses need to know about the sources for each lead and the revenue associated with that lead. Therefore, revenue by the lead source is a critical KPI that keeps track of all lead sources like social media, emails, websites, etc. and the associated revenue.
Revenue by lead source = Total revenue generated from all the leads acquired by each lead source
Let’s explain the importance of this sales KPI with an example. Suppose LinkedIn is a critical source of lead generation for your business. In fact, the business acquires a high percentage of revenue from this source. In comparison, revenue generated through Twitter and Instagram is much lower for the same business.
At this point, the actionable step for the business is to investigate the other channels and identify whether it should continue to invest in them or allocate the budgets of these channels to LinkedIn. The revenue by lead source can help the business in making these decisions.
We hope sales reps and sales managers now have a comprehensive idea of the top B2B sales metrics and why they should track these KPIs and sales metrics to improve their sales performance.
On this note, we want to suggest Salesken, a powerful sales analytics tool that helps sales managers to:

Do you go by the philosophy - “the more prospects, the better”?
Well, generating more leads and engaging with lots of prospects is great! However, if your sales team is putting all their efforts into nurturing low-intent prospects, they are wasting valuable time, money, and other resources.
Ideally, sales managers should encourage the sales reps to focus on quality rather than quantity when it comes to B2B lead generation. And for that, any organization will need an effective B2B sales outreach strategy.
This comprehensive guide sums up some of the most unique yet easy-to-implement B2B sales outreach strategies for organizations in 2023.
Sales outreach is the process of interacting and engaging with prospects, directly or indirectly. The goal of direct and indirect sales outreach is to convert a prospect into a paid customer. A B2B buyer operating in 2023 is always navigating through noisy channels like emails, social media, and so on. A set of sales outreach strategies help the B2B decision-makers to cut through these commotions and get to the appropriate solution they are looking for to solve a problem.
B2B sales outreach works best when sales teams have a consistent, targeted strategy to attract new leads. Depending on the business and its target customers, sales managers can opt for two sales outreach types: inbound and outbound.
Ideally, a combination of these sales outreach types can help the sales reps influence the buying process.
Here are some of the easiest sales outreach strategies that can help businesses power up their outreach process:
Every sales team uses a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool to track and manage the sales leads. However, most sales reps miss out on one thing - identifying the source of these leads.
Imagine you are using multiple outreach channels, including emails, social media, cold calls, etc. You are sending 50+ cold emails, 30+ social media outreach messages, and making 10+ cold-calls daily.
However, what you are not doing is assessing which of these channels is the most effective. When you figure out the source of these leads, you can focus on that channel and take action to multiply leads by personalizing the buyer’s journey for this channel.
Here are a few ways to identify the lead generation sources and segregate them:

A complicated B2B sales outreach process is not scalable. Sales managers and VPs should create a clear and to-the-point sales outreach framework where every sales rep can collaborate.
An ideal sales outreach framework should combine outreach, engagement, and nurturing of the leads. Here are a few tips for B2B sales teams can use to build their sales outreach framework:
For example, suppose you are using an ebook on the website to generate more leads. The lead generation process can follow the below sequence:
In the above image, the first activity - entering an email address to download the ebook and the final activity - sends emails to the user to nurture from a sequence with several other activities.
A recent HubSpot research has shown that 54% of users prefer videos over other types of content like emails, blogs, and downloadable resources. A short and informative video can engage potential buyers without pushing them to purchase from your brand. A video builds the users' interest and increases their urge to know more about your products and services.
Sales teams can use and repurpose videos in various ways. Incorporating videos in email outreach campaigns, social media outreach messages, and selling pitches can derive massive results. Many B2B businesses are using animated videos and explainers to explain a product and its features.
Social proof videos are also getting momentum in B2B sales. These videos show customer stories, testimonials, and results to help the sales process. Reps can use these videos at any sales funnel stage to influence the B2B sales process.
TOFU or Top of the Funnel strategy is about educating the potential buyers throughout their buying journey and navigating them through the awareness stage to the purchase stage. B2B customer journey is complicated and longer (continues up to 3 months on average). The TOFU strategy is ideal for capturing potential buyers’ attention during this time and broadening the sales opportunities.
Some of the proven TOFU strategies for B2B sales reps include:
Did you know that sales professionals spend only 36% of their time on what they are supposed to do? Is that selling? The rest of their time is spent on manual and administrative activities. If you think closely, this is a huge waste of their time and a loss of opportunities for businesses.
A great strategy to address this is by automating sales outreach activities. Some of the easiest ways to do that are:
All these selling automation strategies can help sales teams enhance their productivity as they invest their valuable time in more meaningful activities like research, sales outreach strategy building, and execution.
Many times, sales reps are in a dilemma as they can’t decide whether to follow up or not. Let us tell you, following up is always better than losing on an opportunity. 80% of sales deals require up to 5 follow-up calls before conversion.
B2B sales reps are occupied with several responsibilities and sometimes unintentionally miss out on sales conversations. A personalized follow-up sales outreach message can help the sales reps to re-engage these prospects.
Here’s a follow-up template for sales outreach that B2B selling professionals can use:
Hi [prospect’s name], I hope you are doing well! We had a great call last week and it was a great experience for me learning about [company name] and your role. As a next step, I was hoping to discuss the problems you are facing and how our solution [product name] can help you resolve those challenges. I have attached some information about [product name] to help you solve [business pain points]. Let me know when we can connect to discuss this further. Thank you, [Sales rep’s name]
Well, these emails are personalized for each prospect, making them attention-grabbing. Here are a few tips for writing personalized outreach emails:

B2B consultative selling is about understanding prospects’ needs and requirements before proposing a solution. Here is a comprehensive guide that discusses the what and how of B2B consultative selling to help sales teams.
Consultative selling is a B2B sales approach where sales reps focus on understanding prospects' needs before offering them a solution. Unlike traditional sales methods, in B2B consultative selling, a sales rep prioritizes building and nurturing relationships with prospective customers over simply selling a product.
Consultative selling is part of the inside sales process. It helps the sales team go to the depth of customer needs and then offer a compelling solution.
B2B consultative selling approach is appropriate for sales reps who prefer listening to the prospects, understanding their businesses end-to-end, building a relationship, and finally pitching the perfect solution.
If you are planning to implement consultative selling at your workplace, here are the six steps to get started with:
In the consultative sales process, there is no one-size-fits-all method. Every lead that you generate should be well-researched. Some factors to particularly look for include:
The research step will help sales reps gain as much information as possible regarding the prospective customers. This can help them craft a personalized sales pitch closely aligned with their requirements.
Questions play a key role in consultative selling. The more questions a sales rep asks, the better the chances to learn about the business. Asking open-ended questions to the potential customers will provide lots of opportunities to dig deeper. Questions that start with:
are open-ended questions. Such questions force the prospects to think more about their company and products and provide comprehensive answers to the sales reps’ questions. Note that close-ended questions where buyers are only required to answer with “yes” or “no” don’t work. The scope of knowing the product closely is less when sales reps ask close-ended questions.
When asking questions, sales reps should not make any assumptions. There is nothing “obvious” in B2B consultative selling. Asking more questions and making zero assumptions are the keys to success.
Active listening is the cornerstone of B2B consultative selling. Sometimes reps are so keen to ask the next question, that they forget to listen to what the prospects are saying. This can create a huge communication gap in the consultative sales process.
Rather, the sales reps should practice active listening and note what the buyers are saying to make them feel valued. Ideally, in a B2B sales call, the talk-to-listen ratio should be 35:65. This will help the reps focus solely on the prospective buyer’s pain points and develop the ideal solution.
B2B consultative selling is about changing business development executives' traditional selling mindset. Instead of direct pitching, reps can also focus on educating the prospects. This will help the potential customers figure out what they require and increase their trust in the solution sales reps provide.
While teaching the potential buyers, reps should avoid pitching their product right away. Instead, they should put effort into building trust and loyalty by adding value. This not only helps the prospect to learn something new but also helps them build their preference.
The ultimate goal of any sales process is to qualify the leads and B2B consultative selling is not an exception. However, this selling approach encourages the prospects to follow any popular frameworks between GPCT and BANT.
If a sales rep follows the GPCT sales process, the steps would involve:
Alternatively, a sales personnel can also opt for the BANT framework:
If the first five steps go smoothly, there shouldn’t be any challenges in this stage. When a buyer reaches this stage, the sales reps have already built a strong relationship with them and gained their trust with personalized solutions. At this stage, the sales reps can begin signing the contract and start the onboarding process.
A consultative seller prioritizes three things:
Here are a few tried and tested tips to become a pro at B2B consultative selling:
Remember the phrase “know your customer”? It is one of the primary principles of consultative sales. Here are a few pointers to know your customer properly:
The core focus of consultative selling is to develop trust fuelled by knowledge. 16% of global organizations are fully remote at the moment. The popularity of remote working culture has forced the B2B sales reps to engage in remote prospect engagement.
Remote lead generation and conversion are challenging at times. A great way to approach it is with knowledge-driven trust. The business development executives should focus on educating the prospects instead of pitching the product immediately.
This will add value to the prospects and build their long-term trust.
Each sales conversation is important. Sales teams should store each conversation for future reference - coaching the reps, crafting a personalized pitch, and so on. Every business requires a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to store all sales conversations.
In B2B consultative selling, CRM plays a critical role. Sales reps should make the most of their CRMs to store all information in one place, accelerate the preparation time and optimize the workflow. Sales reps can make the most of their CRMs to ensure transparent, efficient communication with the customers.
The advantages of using your CRM to its full potential include:
In B2B consultative selling, taking control of the sales calls matters. By “taking control”, we don’t mean that only sales reps will keep talking and won’t allow prospects to speak. “Taking control” means knowing and controlling the discussion points in a call.
Here are some easy tips to make the sales conversations count:
Sales reps should be genuinely curious about the prospects and their challenges. It is one of the core skills for sales reps who are practicing consultative selling. With genuine interest, B2B sales reps can achieve the following:

Artificial intelligence is everywhere - including our homes, mobile phones, and more. (Hello, Alexa!)
Businesses are increasingly adopting AI to break through in their niche and lead the way with their competitors.
Although sales are traditionally a person-to-person business, technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are making experts rethink the balance between humans and machines.
According to a Salesforce State of Sales report, sales leaders expect their AI adoption to grow faster than any other technology.
The report also found that high-performing sales teams are 4.9X more likely to use AI than underperforming ones.
So, how can companies leverage technology in their sales process?
Answer - AI Sales Assistant Software.
Let's dive in.
An AI sales assistant software is a tool designed specifically for sales teams to help them by automating processes and tasks with the help of artificial intelligence.
Also known as virtual sales assistants, is a software used to assist with customer service, sales, and marketing. It makes use of speech patterns, sentiment analysis, chatbot technology, and other forms of artificial intelligence and machine learning to help sales reps have more effective conversations with prospects and current customers.
An AI sales assistant automates tasks such as pipeline management, scheduling meetings, data entry, lead qualification, forecasting, and more.
AI sales assistant software is commonly used by sales and marketing teams to automate everyday tasks to focus on selling more deals and oiling the revenue engine.
AI sales assistants typically tend to overlap with a broad range of tools - sales analytics, conversational marketing software, sales intelligence, and guided selling tools.
However, AI sales assistants are much smarter due to their smart task automation capabilities, use of artificial intelligence, and focus on sales teams, ultimately closing more deals.
AI sales assistants help sales teams without replacing the human seller.
In the process of lead generation, lead qualification, nurturing prospects, and converting them into paying customers - there exists a number of labor-intensive activities that are an important part of the sales process.
Sales automation, instead, isolates these repetitive actions, automates them and uses AI to save your sales reps’ energy and time. These include -
Sales automation tools with artificial intelligence can seamlessly automate routine tasks, identify high-priority emails, and create new contacts for you.
Businesses use sales automation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their sales processes.
In addition, these tools minimize the need for sales reps to manually intervene to complete mundane tasks, allowing them to spend more time on high-value tasks such as researching the competitors, understanding their target audience, collaborating, and more.
With sales automation, you can -
When combined with marketing automation, your existing sales assistant software becomes an even more powerful tool that allows you to win more deals while growing your revenue engine.
In recent times alone, we've witnessed major developments and it's not just about making perfect forecasts, but also about minimizing the burden on sales reps, tracking and analyzing conversations, and more.
Here are six ways businesses are using AI sales assistant software -
Even seasoned sales reps find it difficult to track and analyze their leads without the help of external factors.
AI sales assistant software will help you track the behavior of your leads, prioritize them based on their tendency to convert or need the extra push, and forecast the probability of conversion.
In addition, the AI sales assistant software crunches the numbers to give you deeper insights into your lead generation process.
The AI sales assistant software automates everyday tasks such as sending emails to prospects, following up, and more.
Through one-on-one email conversations with every lead, the AI sales assistant software recognizes leads that are ready to purchase and pushes them to the sales team to close the deal.
Never forget and throw away your leads that have a low lead score.
Always keep them stored in your CRM and get your AI sales assistant software to follow up on these leads. Initiate personal conversations, publish content online relevant to these leads' pain points, and support them.
Determine if the lead had true intentions of purchasing your product and if not, keep them in your database to target them with relevant marketing efforts.
Set up your AI sales assistant software to reverse database rot by capturing new lead details, and referrals, and syncing them into the back of your system.
Churn out a sizable chunk of the database annually instead of beginning from the scratch.
The role of AI is to engage your visitors by personalizing their experience and catering to their needs and interests with the right responses.
Move down leads further into the sales funnel by keeping your leads engaged all the way throughout their buyer journey accruing to higher revenue.
Out of all the sales strategies, AI will help you gauge which leads will bring you the most satisfying results and which ones do not.
It can easily merge the efforts of your business by improving the quality of your sales pipeline.
Reduce the costs and efforts your organization bears while increasing the revenue!
While companies with extensive data science teams can sound promising, these platforms aren't meant for sales teams for thriving. It's not all about the math.
Ensure your AI vendor is aware of how an AI sales assistant software should work and they're not providing you with experimental tools. Always double-check for testimonials from customers and ensure the platform is meant to suit both the sales and marketing teams.
No matter how big your sales team is, automation will save you and your sales reps a ton of money, time, and effort.
Before choosing an AI sales assistant, be sure that the tool is capable of automating most everyday tasks of sales processes such as pipeline management, data entry, lead qualification, following up, and more.
By automating non-selling activities, sales reps are empowered to spend 95% of their time focusing on making actual sales.
When it comes to sales, there are various types of environments and entities that will make your sales team switch up their requirements time and again.
Discuss your company size and activities that align with your internal teams - gauge which applications will be used on a daily basis. The best AI sales assistant should be easy to deploy with your existing workflow.
Be sure to check with your vendor about the various options for deployment and try their free trial to actually check them in real-time.
Choose a software that integrates smoothly into your existing workflow using data you already exist.
Take time to assess the list of integration your vendor provides, use open APIs when possible, and do not need much interference to integrate.
The full potential of AI may be years away, but there are already avenues to integrate the technology into modern sales processes today.
Artificial intelligence is widely adopted by businesses alike and is rapidly being adopted by sales teams globally.
Nearly 90% of businesses who use AI say they already are or are planning to use AI for sales forecasting and email marketing.
The sales jobs of the near future will shift their focus to things that AI still struggles with - strategic conversations, complex problem-solving, and human relations.
The majority of advanced sales solutions will focus on human relationships and connections.
In order to harness the maximum capabilities of AI, sales teams will have to place a basic measure of trust to carry out reliable, customer-facing work that people expect.
AI for sales identifies patterns that help a sales rep determine leads that will most likely bring in profits, are easy to convert into deals, and recognize the ones that need that extra push.
If you're looking for an intuitive AI sales assistant software designed to expedite your revenue engine and assist sales and marketing teams for your business, book a demo with our experts to learn more.
AI in sales can be used to help manage and predict customer behavior, automate routine tasks, identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, forecasting, and more. The ultimate goal of AI in sales is to boost efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs.
No, salespeople will not become obsolete, but their need to perform everyday tasks will. AI will only assist and streamline a sales rep's work by automating mundane tasks, prioritizing leads that convert, and improving the revenue engine.
AI can be used in sales to automate everyday tasks, pipeline management, lead generation and prioritization, follow-ups, scheduling meetings, and more.
AI for marketing enables scalable growth, drives revenue, and personalizes customer experience by analyzing numbers, buyer's journey, sending out relevant content, and more.

Artificial intelligence is everywhere - including our homes, mobile phones, and more. (Hello, Alexa!)
Businesses are increasingly adopting AI to break through in their niche and lead the way with their competitors.
Although sales are traditionally a person-to-person business, technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are making experts rethink the balance between humans and machines.
According to a Salesforce State of Sales report, sales leaders expect their AI adoption to grow faster than any other technology.
The report also found that high-performing sales teams are 4.9X more likely to use AI than underperforming ones.
So, how can companies leverage technology in their sales process?
Answer - AI Sales Assistant Software.
Let's dive in.
An AI sales assistant software is a tool designed specifically for sales teams to help them by automating processes and tasks with the help of artificial intelligence.
Also known as virtual sales assistants, is a software used to assist with customer service, sales, and marketing. It makes use of speech patterns, sentiment analysis, chatbot technology, and other forms of artificial intelligence and machine learning to help sales reps have more effective conversations with prospects and current customers.
An AI sales assistant automates tasks such as pipeline management, scheduling meetings, data entry, lead qualification, forecasting, and more.
AI sales assistant software is commonly used by sales and marketing teams to automate everyday tasks to focus on selling more deals and oiling the revenue engine.
AI sales assistants typically tend to overlap with a broad range of tools - sales analytics, conversational marketing software, sales intelligence, and guided selling tools.
However, AI sales assistants are much smarter due to their smart task automation capabilities, use of artificial intelligence, and focus on sales teams, ultimately closing more deals.
AI sales assistants help sales teams without replacing the human seller.
In the process of lead generation, lead qualification, nurturing prospects, and converting them into paying customers - there exists a number of labor-intensive activities that are an important part of the sales process.
Sales automation, instead, isolates these repetitive actions, automates them and uses AI to save your sales reps’ energy and time. These include -
Sales automation tools with artificial intelligence can seamlessly automate routine tasks, identify high-priority emails, and create new contacts for you.
Businesses use sales automation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their sales processes.
In addition, these tools minimize the need for sales reps to manually intervene to complete mundane tasks, allowing them to spend more time on high-value tasks such as researching the competitors, understanding their target audience, collaborating, and more.
With sales automation, you can -
When combined with marketing automation, your existing sales assistant software becomes an even more powerful tool that allows you to win more deals while growing your revenue engine.
In recent times alone, we've witnessed major developments and it's not just about making perfect forecasts, but also about minimizing the burden on sales reps, tracking and analyzing conversations, and more.
Here are six ways businesses are using AI sales assistant software -
Even seasoned sales reps find it difficult to track and analyze their leads without the help of external factors.
AI sales assistant software will help you track the behavior of your leads, prioritize them based on their tendency to convert or need the extra push, and forecast the probability of conversion.
In addition, the AI sales assistant software crunches the numbers to give you deeper insights into your lead generation process.
The AI sales assistant software automates everyday tasks such as sending emails to prospects, following up, and more.
Through one-on-one email conversations with every lead, the AI sales assistant software recognizes leads that are ready to purchase and pushes them to the sales team to close the deal.
Never forget and throw away your leads that have a low lead score.
Always keep them stored in your CRM and get your AI sales assistant software to follow up on these leads. Initiate personal conversations, publish content online relevant to these leads' pain points, and support them.
Determine if the lead had true intentions of purchasing your product and if not, keep them in your database to target them with relevant marketing efforts.
Set up your AI sales assistant software to reverse database rot by capturing new lead details, and referrals, and syncing them into the back of your system.
Churn out a sizable chunk of the database annually instead of beginning from the scratch.
The role of AI is to engage your visitors by personalizing their experience and catering to their needs and interests with the right responses.
Move down leads further into the sales funnel by keeping your leads engaged all the way throughout their buyer journey accruing to higher revenue.
Out of all the sales strategies, AI will help you gauge which leads will bring you the most satisfying results and which ones do not.
It can easily merge the efforts of your business by improving the quality of your sales pipeline.
Reduce the costs and efforts your organization bears while increasing the revenue!
While companies with extensive data science teams can sound promising, these platforms aren't meant for sales teams for thriving. It's not all about the math.
Ensure your AI vendor is aware of how an AI sales assistant software should work and they're not providing you with experimental tools. Always double-check for testimonials from customers and ensure the platform is meant to suit both the sales and marketing teams.
No matter how big your sales team is, automation will save you and your sales reps a ton of money, time, and effort.
Before choosing an AI sales assistant, be sure that the tool is capable of automating most everyday tasks of sales processes such as pipeline management, data entry, lead qualification, following up, and more.
By automating non-selling activities, sales reps are empowered to spend 95% of their time focusing on making actual sales.
When it comes to sales, there are various types of environments and entities that will make your sales team switch up their requirements time and again.
Discuss your company size and activities that align with your internal teams - gauge which applications will be used on a daily basis. The best AI sales assistant should be easy to deploy with your existing workflow.
Be sure to check with your vendor about the various options for deployment and try their free trial to actually check them in real-time.
Choose a software that integrates smoothly into your existing workflow using data you already exist.
Take time to assess the list of integration your vendor provides, use open APIs when possible, and do not need much interference to integrate.
The full potential of AI may be years away, but there are already avenues to integrate the technology into modern sales processes today.
Artificial intelligence is widely adopted by businesses alike and is rapidly being adopted by sales teams globally.
Nearly 90% of businesses who use AI say they already are or are planning to use AI for sales forecasting and email marketing.
The sales jobs of the near future will shift their focus to things that AI still struggles with - strategic conversations, complex problem-solving, and human relations.
The majority of advanced sales solutions will focus on human relationships and connections.
In order to harness the maximum capabilities of AI, sales teams will have to place a basic measure of trust to carry out reliable, customer-facing work that people expect.
AI for sales identifies patterns that help a sales rep determine leads that will most likely bring in profits, are easy to convert into deals, and recognize the ones that need that extra push.
If you're looking for an intuitive AI sales assistant software designed to expedite your revenue engine and assist sales and marketing teams for your business, book a demo with our experts to learn more.
AI in sales can be used to help manage and predict customer behavior, automate routine tasks, identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, forecasting, and more. The ultimate goal of AI in sales is to boost efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs.
No, salespeople will not become obsolete, but their need to perform everyday tasks will. AI will only assist and streamline a sales rep's work by automating mundane tasks, prioritizing leads that convert, and improving the revenue engine.
AI can be used in sales to automate everyday tasks, pipeline management, lead generation and prioritization, follow-ups, scheduling meetings, and more.

B2B Sales teams often face difficulties in accelerating the number of sales conversations. More conversations mean more sales opportunities. However, various administrative and manual activities hold them back from these opportunities.
Suppose an organization hires some expert B2B sales reps to accelerate its sales process. However, they spend their valuable working hours dialing prospects, making cold calls, sending voicemails, call recording calls, data entry, and several other manual activities that can easily be automated. As a result, the sales reps have very little time to research the target market and craft a personalized sales pitch.
So, what is the solution here? How can you remove the pressure of manual tasks so that the sales reps can concentrate on more valuable activities?
A great solution is to invest in a B2B sales dialer to free-up sales reps’ time and help them engage in strategic activities. Read this guide to understand a B2B sales dialer and how it can benefit your sales operations.
B2B Sales dialer is a sales engagement software to make quicker sales calls. Sales dialers reduce the amount of time-consuming administrative activities associated with a sales call and help the reps to interact with more prospects.
Did you know that two-thirds of a sales rep's time goes into non-revenue generating activities? That’s exactly why a B2B sales dialer is a smart investment for sales professionals.

Here are a few reasons why investing in a sales dialer is the need of the hour:
B2B Sales dialers vary based on functions and features. There are three main B2B sales dialer types - Click-to-call dialer, List-based dialer, and Agent-based dialler. Let’s break down each of these sales dialers for you:
Click-to-call dialer plays a significant role in B2B sales. Suppose your sales team identifies a potential client that matches the user persona perfectly. So, what’s the next step? Ideally, sales reps will try to connect with the prospect for the discovery call. Instead of wasting time on manual dialing, a Click-to-call dialer helps you call the number from your laptop or any other device through a simple click. A click-to-call dialer can update each call recording, email, voicemail, etc., within the CRM.
A List-based dialer is where B2B sales professionals can upload a long list of sales prospects to their CRM. Afterward, the sales reps can start calling prospects from the list one by one. The list-based dialer also allows the reps to tick off a phone number dialed already. B2B sales reps can use a List-based dialer to clear visibility into calls and ensure that they can plan the next phone calls accordingly.
Sales calls are often delayed because gatekeepers and B2B sales reps have to wait for a long time before they can speak to the decision-makers. With Agent-based dialers, sales professionals can use robots or human agents to interact with the gatekeepers. As a result, sales reps can only interact with the key decision-makers directly and can shift their entire focus on personalizing the conversations with prospects.
As soon as a B2B sales rep is ready to perform the sales call, the agent or robot will dial the call, communicate with the gatekeepers, and hand over the phone call to the rep when they reach a live person.
Sales dialing should be a critical part of any organization’s B2B Sales process. Here are a few easy tips to improve B2B sales dialing:
The strategic use of B2B sales dialers can help enterprises to a large extent. Some of the critical benefits of B2B sales dialers are discussed below:
A sales dialer simplifies sales connections as it helps reps reach high-level B2B professionals faster. Hence, sales reps can focus on nurturing the leads instead. This can work as an instant productivity booster for the sales reps. It can easily cause a mindset shift for the reps as they no longer need to spend a long time on non-sales activities and focus on building a rapport with potential customers.
Sales dialers can automate one of the most critical parts of sales calls - dialing. Hence, in the presence of a sales dialer, B2B sales managers require lesser resources to convert sales deals. This means a significant reduction in customer acquisition costs, which can later reflect in the overall sales revenue. Sales dialers help the reps fulfill their sales targets faster and free up their time to expand the funnel. This means higher room for profitability.
What if a sales rep prepares thoroughly for the first call, crafts the perfect pitch but never gets to deliver it to the right person. Why? Too many gatekeepers promise to convey your message but never do!
This can demotivate even the most hardworking sales reps and develop a sense of call reluctance. Sales dialers can shift the reps from the self-questioning mode to the productivity mode. Sales dialers easily interact with gatekeepers and connect the reps directly with the central decision-makers. This can boost the self-confidence of reps and help them accelerate the entire process.
Consistent training is the cornerstone of successful sales. Training is particularly important for educating new reps about the B2B selling process, and its core concepts. Without a sales dialer in your sales process, sales managers will have to include an entire section on making sales calls, communicating with gatekeepers, and handling objections. A sales dialer can help the sales managers avoid all these factors and ensure that they spend more time explaining the core concepts of B2B sales to the reps.
A sales dialer software can increase the efficiency of your sales team. A sales dialer ensures that a sales rep is spending the least time on repetitive tasks and automating all tedious activities to avoid the scope of error. However, selecting the right sales dialer can make a lot of difference.
Salesken, an AI-enabled, cloud-based sales engagement platform can integrate with your existing dialer using a simple integration and also has an in-built sales dialer. It can help B2B organizations with a smart sales dialing solution that helps with:
And the list goes on.

Sales calls are often delayed because gatekeepers and B2B sales reps have to wait for a long time before they can speak to the decision-makers. With Agent-based dialers, sales professionals can use robots or human agents to interact with the gatekeepers. As a result, sales reps can only interact with the key decision-makers directly and can shift their entire focus on personalizing the conversations with prospects.
As soon as a B2B sales rep is ready to perform the sales call, the agent or robot will dial the call, communicate with the gatekeepers, and hand over the phone call to the rep when they reach a live person.
Sales dialing should be a critical part of any organization’s B2B Sales process. Here are a few easy tips to improve B2B sales dialing:
The strategic use of B2B sales dialers can help enterprises to a large extent. Some of the critical benefits of B2B sales dialers are discussed below:
A sales dialer simplifies sales connections as it helps reps reach high-level B2B professionals faster. Hence, sales reps can focus on nurturing the leads instead. This can work as an instant productivity booster for the sales reps. It can easily cause a mindset shift for the reps as they no longer need to spend a long time on non-sales activities and focus on building a rapport with potential customers.
Sales dialers can automate one of the most critical parts of sales calls - dialing. Hence, in the presence of a sales dialer, B2B sales managers require lesser resources to convert sales deals. This means a significant reduction in customer acquisition costs, which can later reflect in the overall sales revenue. Sales dialers help the reps fulfill their sales targets faster and free up their time to expand the funnel. This means higher room for profitability.
What if a sales rep prepares thoroughly for the first call, crafts the perfect pitch but never gets to deliver it to the right person. Why? Too many gatekeepers promise to convey your message but never do!
This can demotivate even the most hardworking sales reps and develop a sense of call reluctance. Sales dialers can shift the reps from the self-questioning mode to the productivity mode. Sales dialers easily interact with gatekeepers and connect the reps directly with the central decision-makers. This can boost the self-confidence of reps and help them accelerate the entire process.
Consistent training is the cornerstone of successful sales. Training is particularly important for educating new reps about the B2B selling process, and its core concepts. Without a sales dialer in your sales process, sales managers will have to include an entire section on making sales calls, communicating with gatekeepers, and handling objections. A sales dialer can help the sales managers avoid all these factors and ensure that they spend more time explaining the core concepts of B2B sales to the reps.
A sales dialer software can increase the efficiency of your sales team. A sales dialer ensures that a sales rep is spending the least time on repetitive tasks and automating all tedious activities to avoid the scope of error. However, selecting the right sales dialer can make a lot of difference.
Salesken, an AI-enabled, cloud-based sales engagement platform can integrate with your existing dialer using a simple integration and also has an in-built sales dialer. It can help B2B organizations with a smart sales dialing solution that helps with:
And the list goes on.

A sales dialer is a sales engagement platform that helps sales reps automate the dialing process to avoid tedious activities. It can save sales reps’ time spent on hours of manual dialing and ensure that customer interactions happen seamlessly.
Sales dials can auto-dial phone numbers, while in a phone system, the user needs to dial a number manually. To put it simply, a dialer is the computerized version of a regular phone system.

According to statistics, only 13% of customers believe a sales representative can understand their needs.
Sales, in simple words, is conversation.
Successful sales conversations lead to a winning sales deal. But ask any sales leader what the most difficult part of their job is, and they agree that it’s sales conversations.
If you and your sales team are having trouble warming up and trickling down the sales funnel and wondering how to start a sales conversation, then you are at the right place.
A sales conversation is a conversation between a potential buyer and a sales representative, between two or more people, with the agenda of selling their product or service.
To have an effective sales conversation, your sales team must not only have a strategy in place to lead the call but also undergo sales conversation training.
It is a common myth that exceptional salespersons are born and not made. Sales can be learned. Moreover, not every sales representative is the same and there’s always room for improvement.
Regardless of opting for cold call techniques, social selling strategy, or even email reach outs, focusing on your prospects with dynamic sales scripts and personalisation goes a long way.
With potential buyers making their decision within minutes, it is imperative to have exceptional conversational selling skills to hold their attention and convince them to buy your product.
One of the most run-of-the-mill conversation starters in a sales call is spearheading the call with a sales pitch. We’ve all been victims of annoying and irrelevant sales messages. In addition, rehearsing a common sales script with every kind of customer is no longer effective too.
Sales representatives need to make a real connection with their buyers; you need to show them that your solution will genuinely solve their problem and not just be interested in pushing a sale.
Not every sales call will lead to a successful sale.
Understanding how your product or service will solve a potential buyer’s pain points is vital. Ensure you know what key features and benefits your product has to offer and understand the concept to the T.
When you focus on the benefits and not on features, you are assuring your clients that you truly want to solve their problems beyond just making your sale.
In addition, focusing on benefits will help them tick their checklist against their issue as opposed to iterating the features.
Let’s say you are selling a smartphone - talking about an array of its features will not help the customer visualise them. Instead, talking about how the camera’s capabilities, storage options, and excellent display features with a show and tell kind of demo will definitely aid the sale.
The old-school adage that “the customer is always right” doesn’t hold true anymore.
As sales reps, you are experts in your field. To get the most out of your clients, it is necessary to ask the right kind of questions, especially open-ended ones where the sales conversation flows easily. So, avoid asking dead-end questions that end with “yes” or “no”.
Open-ended conversations not only make the conversation engaging, but they also help you grasp the customer’s requirements. Questions like “What are your objectives?” and “How are you planning on using our product?” can also reveal crucial information about the buyer’s pain point and let you have a sneak peek into their organisation as well.
One of the key drivers to effective sales conversations is articulating a clear agenda of the call. Check with the client if this is okay with them beforehand to avoid roadblocks.
This way, you are in control of your call and accomplish what you want to achieve by the end of the conversation while making the customer feel that, in fact, they are in control of the conversation.
Setting an agenda not only helps you avoid distractions in between the call but also helps you stay focused and sell your product the right way.
Leverage sales talk technologies such as Salesken to set a plan in place by keeping track of important pointers on the dashboard and making use of the technology to assist you in your next sales call.
A customer who has done their research will inevitably bring up your competitor during the sales conversation.
It is imperative to understand that your customer is only trying to weigh in options and gauge what’s best for them. The biggest self-sabotage you can do is by speaking ill of your competitor in such calls.
According to research, whenever you bad mouth someone, your audience puts you in the same category. Do not mudsling your competitors. Instead, show and tell your buyers with definite differentiators and help them perceive their future with you vs your competitor.
This process not only instils trust in your client but also helps you stand out from your competition.
To avoid falling into conversation traps, you need to be prepared for tough queries. This will take a combination of conversational selling skills to perfect, but most importantly, be ready with relevant data to support your statements.
The key to any successful sale is the ability to establish trust between you and your potential client. If you can’t, then you are unlikely to make the sale.
Some ways to establish trust and help your customers come to a decision is by displaying proof of success with the right kind of data and trust factors such as testimonials, case studies, and general data on how your service has genuinely helped a customer.
This establishes proof of trust and helps them kickstart their decision quickly.
As sales representatives, we’re the experts of selling our solution to the buyer’s problem. But, the truth is, selling is more than just one-sided talking but more listening.
According to statistics, top performers boast a 46:54 talk-to-listen ratio, meaning they speak less than 50% of the time.
By listening more to your customers and not interrupting their train of thought every chance you get, you will discover valuable information, make stronger connections, and avoid rambling, in turn letting them know that you truly care about solving their problem.
To be a star performer, make the customer the center of your sales conversation.
With the right skill of listening, you tend to ask the right kind of questions that reveal the buyer’s pain points and their objectives which help you think from the buyer’s shoes.
As a sales expert, it is easy to check off your box and think that you have all the answers you need, but in reality, you’re only getting started.
Understand the customer’s pain points on all levels to comprehend the business implications of their problem, life implications, and how your service will solve this.
For instance, the potential client may need high-level integrations so the marketing team and the sales team can automate their work rather than spending all their time on manual tasks.
It is vital for you as a sales rep to listen to the buyer closely, jot down their pain points, and connect the dots with your solution to give them answers.
With complex accounts comes complex problems.
Deals that contain multiple participants in a sales call from the selling company are 258% more likely to close the deal as opposed to a solo rep during the entire sales cycle. In simple words, team selling works.
Top-performing salespeople typically join their CEOs, sales managers, product experts, and other important stakeholders in their sales calls. Team selling helps the potential buyer understand the crux of the issue, and provide them with solutions from the right mix of experts to establish their authority in the conversation.
No generic sales script works well for all sale conversations. To be human is to be personal.
In other words, personalise your sales conversation, including both written and cold conversations. Say goodbye to your generic templates and approach each prospect in a personalised way. This not only demonstrates professionalism but also establishes credibility and expertise.
Personalisation may be time-consuming, but it is worth it. Being human and relating to the buyer’s issues is always warmly welcomed.
Before you sell your product, you need to foresee your conversation by creating value in your prospect’s eye.
The best way to demonstrate this is to help them understand your expertise in the field by discussing the right parameters and providing them value with your solution.
Top sales representatives spend more time talking about business and value-related subjects than average performers.
Establish an organic conversational funnel by discussing the possible pain points and outcomes and proving why your solution is the right fit for them.
Subjects in this category include ROI, the buyer’s pain points, timeline and objectives, benefits, and so on.
Now that we have established what to do in a successful sales conversation, below are five tips to avoid in a sales conversation.
Talking too much and not giving the customer a chance to speak is a rookie error. Talking less and listening intently to the customer will help you detect the customer’s intent and unique requirements and iterate accordingly. It is key to a successful sale.
Although it is a good practice to give the best to your customer, overpromising with your solution is another common pitfall to avoid. If you end up talking to a skilled negotiator, they will recognise this mistake almost immediately and potentially exploit it. Know the value of your product, learn how to negotiate about it, and highlight the right benefits.
While it is completely okay to believe in your product and sell it accordingly, objecting to the buyer’s objections about shortcomings comes across as rude.
In typical sales conversations, it is common to face questions and objections about your product. Preparing for these questions beforehand helps you navigate them with ease instead of coming across as defensive or impolite and losing the client altogether.
As a salesperson, you have an agenda to close the sale; every interaction you initiate should reinforce this. Setting up a sales call takes a lot of effort, so when the prospect shows up, make sure you have the agenda for the next call and carry them through the steps. Always close the call with clarity on the next steps, so you are always in touch with the buyer and do not lose the intent to close the sale.
Although these tips sound like a lot to remember, with Salesken’s intuitive features built especially for successful sales conversations, you can scale your agenda to close the deal quicker than expected.
Sales conversation technologies help you keep track of all your agendas through minimal manual work and lets you focus on the right metrics to close the deal as expected. Book a demo today!

The sales ecosystem today is increasingly competitive for both buyers and sellers. We’ve all hit roadblocks while selling a product to a potential client. Questions around a specific technical feature, deep integration, or even about a competitor’s feature is a definite hiccup that stops the deal from closing.
With complex deals, the easier the process it is to sell the product to the client, the more convinced they will be.
What if we told you there is a reliable method to improve your sales process and minimize these roadblocks?
Enter team selling.
Read on to find out how your sales team can leverage the art of team selling to close deals faster and the secrets to finding sales success.
In simple words, team selling refers to the process which makes use of a collaborative approach that is commonly used in account-based selling to close more deals.
Team selling, also called cross-functional selling, is where the sales department brings in two or more reps from different departments to close a sale efficiently.
The process is all about leveraging effective communication and the required skills of a cross-functional sales team that leads to successful collaboration in sales.
For instance, let’s say you are selling a highly complex product to an enterprise account, where your sales rep understands the workability of the product but is not aware of its technicality.
This is where you bring in more participants in your sales call to increase your credibility and answer potential questions from the client to allay the buyer’s concerns around the process, integrations, and so on.
Selling is all about simplifying the buying process as much as possible.
Team selling is one of the ways to do it.
By leveraging the best minds from various departments during the call, this sales strategy allows you to obtain deep insights into the customer’s needs and vice versa.
Apart from improving the buyer experience, here are some of the advantages of incorporating team selling as a part of of your sales strategy.
‍
Each team member of your company brings immense value to the table, meaning more people have valuable information about a key account. These team members will add definite worth to getting the most effective solution to the sales process in case of a hiccup.
One of the benefits of team selling is that the team focuses on the specific task, which helps in the iterative process, which in turn sheds more light on your product.
Prospective clients want to feel valued.
With team selling, you bring in expert members from all departments, including product, sales, engineering, and marketing, to instill a sense of trust in them as not just a seller, but also as a brand.
This sense of trust is exactly what a successful enterprise relies on before forming long-term relationships with your organization.
When you involve specialists from all sections of your organization to smoothen the process of buying, you are more likely to establish trust and address their concerns with clarity.
Presenting your buyer by bringing in a team of experts exponentially increases your credibility in the market and builds enhanced trust in your product by going that extra mile to support all the needs of your customer.
As your team inclines towards expertise and insights, you tend to ask important questions from the clients to ensure a smooth sale and gather all the required information you need to get an oversight of your client’s needs.
Team selling aids this process by narrowing down on the client’s main concerns to identify roadblocks faster. This shortens the sales cycle while improving client satisfaction along the way.
Although team selling sounds very reassuring, it isn’t right for every situation.
Buyers with smaller needs might be overwhelmed, while others might be more interested in a deeper relationship with your team.
Team selling makes sense in these four unique cases:
When a potential deal is multi-faceted with multiple factors to consider, it is best handled by a team of experts. A complex sale can consist of account planning, negotiations, legal issues, cross-functional issues, and more.
When your account is eight or ten times larger than your typical account, putting together a diverse sales team will not only bring in authority but also help you uncover potential roadblocks to identify the best resources needed to win the sale.
Typically, a large enterprise SaaS account takes anywhere between 3-5 months to close.
To speed up the process, team selling can expedite the sale without setting a faux deadline or putting unnecessary pressure on the prospect.
Bring in concerned team members specific to the client’s concern to address the issue quickly and move forward.
Most clients love to feel important. Most sales, especially big ones, move quickly if you give them access to the C-level.
While this isn’t always possible, you can consider it depending on how valuable the account may be to you. When prospects feel valued by your team, they share valuable information and offers to be a vital resource.
Team selling adds leverage to the account by helping your clients in unique ways for different functions to make them feel important.
Team selling is a powerful sales strategy that promises big returns, but only when implemented in the right way.
Before incorporating team selling, consider factors like which key accounts you wish to leverage for team selling, any important members you want on the call, who should lead the call and what support you need from management.
Your team selling will comprise of an internal team and an external team, in some capacity. The internal team will consist of AEs, SDRs, marketing managers, product teams, and support teams. The external team will include communities, customers and their reviews, integrated products, and more.
Here are a few ways to implement team selling effectively:
When building your core team members for team selling, it is vital to pick the right people with appropriate skills, experience, and strategy.
From sales reps to marketing managers to product specialists, they can all take center stage to add in expertise at various stages in the sales call.
Each team member will contribute to making a big impact. Cross-functional selling works best when team members have skills and personalities that complement each other to support the sale.
Although team selling is leveraged in an organization to make complicated deals simpler, team selling can prove to be tricky if your team isn’t aware of their roles and misalign the goals.
Ensure you rehearse before getting on the sales call with your client. Pick a sales leader and have them cue other participants to speak at the right time, whenever required. Make sure everyone knows the product and the demo sequence in and out.
Sharing product knowledge between the team members and the client is crucial for a successful sale.
With a myriad of moving parts of the demo and a number of members involved in the call, setting a defined path to lead the call might not be as easy as expected.
Team selling is a team sport and can often be perceived as messy to handle overly complex sales.
To avoid this, making use of account roadmaps to visualize your product’s path to the client helps your team members and the client understand your product, identify gaps in the pitch, and avoid duplicate work.
One of the primary challenges of team selling is establishing a reward system for individual team members that perform exceptionally well.
Regardless of team selling vs individual selling, setting a clear compensation can be a challenge to appreciate those members who display excellent skills. In team selling, this can pose a problem.
To avoid this, set the right award system in order to motivate your team to close the sales deal efficiently.
Team selling is the most effective when your team showcases why the client should pick you.
With multiple moving parts, knotted contexts, and various decision-makers involved, it is possible to lose focus on your end goal.
The secret?
Make use of your tech stack.
To stay on top of the deal, your tech stack can prove to be extremely useful. Leverage your sales leader as the fulcrum to manage better usage of your CRM throughout the cycle.
Technology tools like Salesken can help you narrow down your pitch even further by picking the right feature such as call tracking metrics, analyzing the client’s emotions, assisting you with the right data for follow-ups, and more.
Coordination, as a result, is vital. Leveraging the right kind of technology can make large enterprise account sales easier.
As exciting as team selling is, identifying the right kind of accounts to pass on to your team selling members is crucial to determine its value.
According to reports, team selling is the most effective for deals between 5-10x your average deal size.
With large enterprise accounts, the benefits of load distribution and bringing in a fresh perspective from various members of your company to the sales pitch can make team selling a great option.
Don’t let the lack of complete product knowledge be a major roadblock between you and your client.
Control the performance of your team in the sales call to avoid surprises about your product and other processes.
To avoid this, always go in the call by preparing beforehand and letting the sales leader spearhead the pitch carefully.
‍Practicing sales calls beforehand, analyzing the sales pipeline, reviewing the client’s profiles, and more will set you up well in advance for your next meeting. Set bigger and achievable goals for your team members to help them improve their skills and achieve personal goals easily, and in turn, close the sales deal faster.
With team selling, closing that big sales deal can become a reality and also get you closer to building a lasting relationship with the client.
It establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy with the client both during and after the sales cycle and helps you come across as a champion in your field.

An effective sales management software can help your business reach, or even exceed your revenue goals in the long run.
Most businesses in the modern-day rely on a sales management system to manage their sales cycle and grow revenue.
But, when most people refer to a CRM platform, they're referring to software or tools that enable them to improve business relationships and manage their ever-growing teams easily.
However, customer relationship management varies depending on the department of usage. For instance, the support team might leverage the CRM software to manage service tickets, while the marketing team may use it to analyze their campaigns.
The CRM platform inevitably assists salespeople throughout their sales cycle and aids them with valuable support enabling them to be efficient and close deals.
In this guide, we'll talk about -
Let's dive in.
To put it simply, sales management is the process of building a sales force by planning, recruiting, training, organizing, coordinating, and implementing successful sales techniques that consistently perform well to meet its targets.
A sales management system is an absolute must for all businesses trying to hit their revenue goals, each quarter.
Regardless of the industry your business operates in, managing sales and boosting sales performance for all sizes of businesses, the secret to success is leveraging a sales management strategy.
Besides helping your organization to meet its revenue goals, the sales management tool also allows you to stay up to date with industry trends and can play a vital role in helping you flourish in a highly competitive marketplace.
A sales management system, also known as sales management software, or sales CRM, is a type of technology that is designed to simplify the sales process.
Salespeople can use the software to track sales data, manage customer data, pipeline management, and automate mundane tasks to focus on driving sales.
Today's sales management systems are far more sophisticated that come with a variety of modules and features - social profiles, online activity, sentiment analysis, peer coaching, and more.
A sales management software is a centralized system that helps sales managers to implement and carry out the best sales techniques, manage sales opportunities and operations, boost productivity, and close deals.
A good CRM platform is a one-stop solution that significantly improves all challenges of the sales management practices.
Regardless of the industry your business functions in, no two businesses are the same.
Ideally, your sales process should replicate the buying process and be self-explanatory for your sales teams and customers to understand.
The sales management process typically involves the following steps -
Lead generation is a vital step in the sales management process.
Typically, lead generation is a marketing process, where marketing teams capture the interest of potential customers via highly targeted campaigns.
For modern businesses, channeling their digital mediums has proven to be highly impactful based on online and social selling techniques.
Lead generation is the first step of the process, before the lead scoring and qualification. Post this, qualified leads are passed on to the sales teams for conversion.
Lead scoring and qualification is the process where you score and qualify leads based on their tendency to purchase your product.
The definition of 'qualification' varies from company to company.
There are three types of lead qualification - marketing qualified lead (MQL), sales qualified lead (SQL), and product qualified lead (PQL).
The kind of lead qualification makes it clear to the sales manager if the lead is worth chasing. During this step in your sales process, your team will qualify the leads based on lead scoring.
Lead scoring refers to the manner in which your leads are scored and ranked based on a set number of criteria determined by the sales manager in the organization.
Setting revenue goals and quotas each quarter for your entire sales team, as well as individual reps to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal.
You can set a variety of sales goals including job functions, training, onboarding, or anything that fits the bill. Before locking the goals and quotas, be sure to clearly communicate across teams, so there is no confusion thereafter.
These goals can be set manually, or by leveraging a sales intelligence tool such as Salesken via sales enablement kits that can have a central repository system to refer back to.
Another primary responsibility of the sales management process is to onboard and train new hires.
Onboarding and training new hires without a CRM platform or a sales intelligent tool can be daunting and might lead to manual errors. By being a part of the onboarding and training process, you can ensure all sales reps are on the same level and have a clear understanding of your processes.
Leveraging CRM software to train new hires can be a breeze. The CRM software assists sales managers across the organization to be on par with their peers, learn about their sales accounts and get a hands-on learning experience from the best sales reps via their coaching moments, and more.
The process of turning the lead into a customer is called a lead conversion.
Typically, these interests are captured from lead generation campaigns - the interested customer will leave behind their phone number, email address, or other details to learn more about your product.
The prospect is then captured by the CRM software to assign the lead to a sales rep to start the process of lead conversion.
The sales rep showcases the product, supports and motivates the prospect to purchase by providing the right kind of sales collateral, and will be available throughout to close the deal.
The successful conversion is the result of a seamless, well-informed, and communicative sales approach, powered by CRM software.
This is the stage where sales teams learn if the deal has been lost or won.
At this stage, sales reps must set up a tentative date to close the deal. This can help sales teams to understand and track the deal at each stage within the sales pipeline.
Once the sales team converts a lead into a paying customer, the journey does not end there.
Maintaining a good customer relationship to support and enhance their journey is the most important part of closing deals.
The customer's details are then passed on to the customer success teams to help them guide their clients, answer any queries, and offer assistance whenever required.
Retaining an existing customer is more challenging than acquiring a new customer.
Always ensure that your product is beneficial for the customer, and if not, help them unlock your product's true potential by providing round-the-clock assistance.
There are three key aspects of sales management within the sales process -
This process might vary from business to business, but key aspects such as operations, analysis, and strategy remain as focal points.
The first step of sales operations is to hire a great sales operations manager.
Once you've hired a great sales operations manager, expanding the team should be the ideal next step in the process.
The sales team is the backbone of your company - they bring in revenue, act as a direct point of contact between the customer and the product, and are the face of your product.
For any sales team to perform exceptionally well, they must be equipped with the best resources to progress and flourish rather than just be viewed as the "team that rakes in the moolah."
Before selecting and onboarding new sales hires, ensure you spend enough time training them and developing their skills.
Sales people should not just be great sellers, but also need to be great at selling your product and be the face of the organization that customers want to work with.
Once you have fully functioning and high-value team members, it is time to start setting goals and track their performance. To do this, you need to -
But the sales manager's job is not done here.
It's also their responsibility to track and counsel the team throughout the process to make sure they are on track and motivate them when needed by providing the right assistance.
Sales managers can easily coach and motivate their teams with the help of CRM software that can pull out data from similar deals, provide the right cues to close the deals, and even learn about the prospect in-depth.
Once the sales teams and revenue goals are in place, the most prominent question arises - what is the sales process of your company to actually carry out the sales and close deals?
This process varies from company to company, but essentially, you are facilitating a transaction between a company and its customers by moving them through the process which leads to an exchange.
Every business has its own sales cycle, which is a series of set tasks that helps a company to reach its customers. Therefore, having a sales pipeline, or a sales funnel will simplify the process to maneuver these deals to conversion.
Simply put, the sales pipeline helps salespeople stay organized and be on top of their work. It also is a direct indicator of how well the prospect is interacting with your product, and how likely they are to close.
Sales activities that are within a sales person's control include -
Tracking the sales pipeline and reporting helps you to understand if your current strategy affects your company's success and reach, and gives you deeper insight into what you can do to improvise to meet your goals.
Successful reporting involves using quantifiable indicators, or metrics that indicate how each aspect of your sales operations is performing and if you are achieving your targets.
With the sales funnel in place, you should be able to measure the following four metrics -
A CRM software will help you learn deeper into each deal with the help of relevant metrics and reports to help you streamline your sales management process.
Still wondering why your team should leverage a sales management system?
Here are 5 key benefits that will transform the way you sell -
A sales management system coordinates and automates sales data from departments across the organization in a central repository system.
Everyone involved in the sale can access this information in real-time through the platform, communicate directly with the customer and stay up to date.
Not just that, this also reduces the need for lengthy meetings while encouraging teams to work towards a common goal - making that sale and improving productivity!
A sales management platform helps sales teams to organize all customer-related information in one single place that is easily accessible to all team members and help streamline your process.
It can process and analyze data and produce easy to comprehend reports with relevant information, thus saving time.
Sales teams can cut down half their tasks by automating trivial admin tasks with the help of a sales management system.
Instead of manually feeding in data or sending follow-up emails, the sales team can focus on actually making the sale while the platform takes care of the necessary admin tasks with a simple, yet powerful workflow.
Without a stable sales management system, it can be extremely challenging for sales managers to stay on top of their sales data.
A CRM platform aids sales managers with up-to-date information on the status of each lead so the sales team can never miss an opportunity and prioritize their time with the prospect with a high tendency to convert.
Ultimately, sales managers leverage resources such as a sales management system to track their revenue goals.
These platforms are intuitive in nature - they help sales teams optimize their sales process so each lead is more likely to close and give more attention to high-value opportunities.
By keeping their teams informed and organized by providing the right set of data, sales managers can easily exceed their sales targets and meet their goals.
Sales is all about getting the right data at the right time.
Modern CRM systems have progressed so much that they have the ability to push sales deals and provide an organized sales pipeline to close the deal.
Here are some of the key features of a CRM that will help businesses to improve their sales performance and accelerate their revenue goals easily -
A vital part of the sales process, besides lead qualification, is lead scoring.
Lead scoring should be the primary step in your sales process, so it can be highly relevant and is helpful if your sales management system can automatically score them as they enter the pipeline.
Lead scoring helps the team to understand the real value of the lead and set realistic goals for themselves.
In addition, although most businesses rely on various sources for lead generation, your sales management tool should allow you to automate the lead assignment process by defining a workflow based on which leads are assigned to a set of sales reps.
A good sales management software should let you configure various criteria based on your industry-specific requirements so that only the leads that fit the bill are assigned to reps.
Understanding when to interact with your qualified leads before they turn cold is important.
With the help of a CRM for sales management, sales reps can immediately know when a lead visits your website, fills in a form, opens your email, or even mentions your company name on social media.
Stop relying on guesswork and seize the opportunity while the lead is still hot with sales management software.
Most businesses rely on the live chat feature in hopes of turning around their customer service and catering to all customer queries.
Unfortunately, the live chat feature, when they are not intuitive, work on a set of defined rules, giving customers a very robotic feel.
When the live chat is accompanied by artificial language and machine learning, it becomes a highly interactive tool that lets customers/visitors have the best user experience and cater to all their needs with a human-like language.
Sales reps can notice and help the customers if they are stuck on a blog post, do not understand the payment system, or even need more information.
The sales pipeline gives you a quick overview of your deals and helps you understand the individual stages the customer is at.
Not just that, a CRM helps you create a sales process unique to your organization.
As your organization grows, it is important that your sales process becomes scalable. Having a thorough knowledge of your pipeline with a defined sales process helps you decide what steps to take in order to close the deal.
Ensure that the sales management CRM you choose lets you customize and keep a close eye on your deals, what stage they are at, the assistance they might need to close the deal, and the numbers associated with it in a compact view.
This can be easily achieved by building a scalable process inside your sales management tool.
Having a sales process mapped out helps sales reps focus on their customer while prospecting with the knowledge of what to do at every stage of the pipeline.
Artificial intelligence is not a novel technology. It’s been in the industry for years now, and is an important part of the modern sales approach.
As a sales manager, you want your sales reps to focus on actually making a sale and bringing in revenue.
This can be done if your sales team automates mundane admin tasks and spends more time talking to your prospects.
An efficient sales management CRM should be powered with artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate repeat admin tasks and let your sales reps improve their productivity and close more deals.
Set up a workflow so salespeople do not miss important emails, send relevant sales enablement content, and have a quick overview of the status of the deal with a CRM.
What is the use of data without insights?
When you accumulate massive amounts of data, it can get daunting.
A sales management CRM helps your team to track, spot key trends, analyze cues, and provide additional assistance with the right analytics and forecast metrics to make better decisions.
Keep a close eye on key performance metrics, targets, and pipeline goals for the month with the CRM.
Typically, even after convincing your prospect to purchase your product, there might be one too many objections.
Some of the most common objections in the sales cycle include pricing, product quality, customer support, post-sales service, delivery time, and more. During the negotiation phase, it is vital to identify the real cause behind the deal, in case of rejection.
Once the cause is identified, the sales rep can feed this into the system so the software learns about negotiation and handling objections in the right way so sales reps do not repeat the same mistake in the future.
Want to help your reps handle sales objections like a pro? With Salesken’s Real-Time Assistance, sales reps share best responses to objections, winning hooks and best negotiations tactics, with your team in real-time. Replicate winning strategies of your top reps in real-time and improve sales outcomes.

Although there are lots of moving parts and intricacies, with the right strategies and workflows in place, you can efficiently manage your sales teams, manage goals, maintain relationships, and meet your goals.

An effective sales management software can help your business reach, or even exceed your revenue goals in the long run.
Most businesses in the modern-day rely on a sales management system to manage their sales cycle and grow revenue.
But, when most people refer to a CRM platform, they're referring to software or tools that enable them to improve business relationships and manage their ever-growing teams easily.
However, customer relationship management varies depending on the department of usage. For instance, the support team might leverage the CRM software to manage service tickets, while the marketing team may use it to analyze their campaigns.
The CRM platform inevitably assists salespeople throughout their sales cycle and aids them with valuable support enabling them to be efficient and close deals.
In this guide, we'll talk about -
Let's dive in.
To put it simply, sales management is the process of building a sales force by planning, recruiting, training, organizing, coordinating, and implementing successful sales techniques that consistently perform well to meet its targets.
A sales management system is an absolute must for all businesses trying to hit their revenue goals, each quarter.
Regardless of the industry your business operates in, managing sales and boosting sales performance for all sizes of businesses, the secret to success is leveraging a sales management strategy.
Besides helping your organization to meet its revenue goals, the sales management tool also allows you to stay up to date with industry trends and can play a vital role in helping you flourish in a highly competitive marketplace.
A sales management system, also known as sales management software, or sales CRM, is a type of technology that is designed to simplify the sales process.
Salespeople can use the software to track sales data, manage customer data, pipeline management, and automate mundane tasks to focus on driving sales.
Today's sales management systems are far more sophisticated that come with a variety of modules and features - social profiles, online activity, sentiment analysis, peer coaching, and more.
A sales management software is a centralized system that helps sales managers to implement and carry out the best sales techniques, manage sales opportunities and operations, boost productivity, and close deals.
A good CRM platform is a one-stop solution that significantly improves all challenges of the sales management practices.
Regardless of the industry your business functions in, no two businesses are the same.
Ideally, your sales process should replicate the buying process and be self-explanatory for your sales teams and customers to understand.
The sales management process typically involves the following steps -

Imagine this-you're on a call with a prospect, and the prospect reveals vital information about their company, their goals, and why they’re considering your organization to solve their problem.
As a sales rep, you can only listen and maybe, note down only a few takeaways from the conversation. But, what happens if you want to revisit the conversation summary, so you’re not missing out on any important detail?
Are you thinking of call recording software?
Companies have been recording calls for years, but unfortunately, the recordings usually live in a dust folder in a floating cloud. Even if you do access the calls, very few people, use them in a meaningful way.
So, how can sales teams use the call recordings to derive actionable insights?
Enter conversation intelligence software.
When most people hear about conversation intelligence, the first thought is that it is a chatbot.
But unlike chatbots, conversational intelligence software, or conversation AI is capable of assisting sales reps to achieve their goals seamlessly in tandem with human intelligence.
Conversation intelligence software records, transcribes and analyzes every conversation and helps teams derive data driven insights from them.
Conversational intelligence technology offers a myriad of benefits to organizations and sales teams alike.
Conversation AI helps sales teams gain an understanding of what’s going on in the sales deal, surface the right information at the right time, and ensure no action items fall through the crack post-call.
Rather than relying on surface-level assessments of written or spoken information, conversation intelligence leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to seamlessly deduce intent, provide meaningful insights, and sentiment from real-time data.
Some of the key points that a sales team can capture during the conversation are -
Rather than relying on surface-level assessments of written or spoken information, conversation intelligence leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to seamlessly deduce intent, provide meaningful insights, and sentiment from real-time data.
Most conversation intelligence platforms also match relevant metadata to the conversations, including contact names, phone numbers, associated CRM fields, call direction and duration.
Conversation intelligence technology utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the customer’s sentiment, intent, and meaning.
The technology records sales conversations, analyzes it, and delivers it in palpable formats for sales teams to apply to their sales strategy. Conversation AI makes use of algorithms to analyze useful information that can slip through the cracks by sales reps.
For instance, conversation AI can identify markers in a sales conversation that showcases the client showing hesitation to purchase your product and provides reactive solutions for the sales rep to act upon.
This information can be analyzed by sales managers to understand the tactics of best-performing sellers, to be applied company-wide to mimic winning strategies.
It can also take the load off of customer success reps by handling customer enquiries on its own or extracting data much more efficiently from past conversations.
Conversation technology software broadly uses these two actions to achieve this -
Conversation AI converts customer inputs (text or speech) into a computer-readable format that makes it easy to analyze and determine the customer's intention. This typically involves using complex processes like lexical semantics (study of word meanings) analysis, extraction of relationships, name recognition, sentiment recognition, and more.
Once the software analyzes the conversation, the technology generates a suitable response with the help of natural language processing (NLP), so the sales rep can leverage it for their sales conversation. Over time, these responses become very accurate and useful with machine learning.
Conversation intelligence software can be used extensively to measure the quality of sales conversations, anchor these conversations to move the deal further, or analyze it further to close deals quickly.
Ready to start using conversation AI? Let’s see how this technology might be extremely valuable for sales organizations.
1. Enhance Team Coaching and Rep Development
2. Provide Real-Time Support to Move the Deal
3. Automating Recurring Sales Processes
4. Reform Useful Data into Successful Deals
As described earlier, most people bucket their notions regarding conversation AI simply as chatbots.
However, these tools are much more equipped and capable than just chatbots.
With chatbots, the human element and intelligence is removed - limiting its capabilities to just automatic responses.
Here are 5 reasons why switching to a conversation intelligence platform is useful for a B2B organization -
Conversation Intelligence tools record, analyze and provide insights into every customer interaction. With this, sales managers can identify how their reps are performing in the calls, know what they are doing right, where they are struggling and provide targeted feedback for improvement.
The sales managers can also identify the actions of top performing sellers vs bottom-performers, and replicate the winning strategies of the top reps across.
Regardless of the sales rep’s expertise, there are moments when even the most well-equipped sales rep struggles to answer their customers’ questions and objections.
The only factor that sets a winning sales team from the other teams is their ability to handle customer queries smoothly.
A strong coaching process helps, but it can only go so far without the aid of the right tools for real-time support.
Conversation technology uses AI to analyze sales conversations and provides reactive and proactive cues to the sales rep in easy, digestible formats with the correct talking points such as -
Conversation AI assists sales reps to answer such objections in a structured manner.
It turns pesky rejections as signs for improvement, delays in responses will be seen as an entity to categorize issues and assign a relevant sales rep, and more.
Sales teams are always performing routine administrative tasks and check-ups.
According to Salesforce, sales reps spend only 34% of their time in actual selling.
Not only are they spending the majority of their time in non-selling activities, because these tasks are manual, there are high chances of making human errors that often go unnoticed.
Conversation intelligence platforms are optimal to not just free up sales reps’ time but also drastically reduce human errors by automating recurring processes.
This process optimization enhances the value of every sales transaction by cutting sales time in half.
Most sales organizations invest millions in digital sales technology, often implementing disparate systems which may or may not contribute to the revenue engine.
When salestech tools do not integrate with existing systems, data usually sits in a dark box preventing sales managers from accurately guessing the cracks, or overall progress of the team and deal performance.
Because these managers lack the detailed insights required for personalized coaching, reps typically are disinterested and regard coaching as generic and unimportant.
Conversation AI tools such as Salesken provides a robust solution that aids sales managers with instant access during sales meetings to provide individual, personalized feedback.
Data such as feedback on meetings, talking points, improvisation, and more can be accessed by a single click which allows for directly referenceable, coachable moments derived from real-time moments.
Conversation intelligence also eliminates the surprise element in critical sales calls by bringing up call summaries, key takeaways, action items, and course-corrects you with reactive and proactive cues.
With quick access to action items, summaries, call snippets, and other coachable moments, sales reps can mitigate risks early on, effectively keeping track of the deal.
Modern, powerful AI tools are incrementally more capable than just pre-defined answers by delivering trends, compelling moments, daily notifications to managers and reps’ inboxes.
Although conversations are the best avenue to extract learnings for sales conversations, there are a couple of challenges when it comes to implementing conversation AI.
Unlike other salestech software, conversation intelligence is a blue ocean with a limited number of players acing the niche. Despite the low density, it’s still challenging to rely independently on the tool.
Here are 3 challenges of levering conversation intelligent software -
Although conversation AI tools are getting progressively simple to use, there are still some difficulties that can be defeated to expand the number of useful use-cases adopted by sales individuals, who are open to using the technology.
Thus, instructing your user based on opportunities can enable the tool to be easily adopted across the organization and make a better experience for individuals who are not comfortable using it.
With voice assistants and a software that basically translates your sales conversations and records it, it is of utmost priority to safeguard the organization’s privacy.
Organizations characterizing these channels must be conveyed to the clients to establish a foundation of trust and high-security norms must be put in place, particularly while performing sensitive individual data.
Conversation AI tools must be planned with security in mind to guarantee the protection.
Only opt for tools that are GDPR compliant and have high-security norms in place to avoid being a victim of phishing and hacking.
Regardless of the voice of input being voice or text, language input can be a difficult area for conversation intelligence tools.
Various dialects and background noise can directly affect the effectiveness of the conversation AI’s capability to comprehend the raw input. In addition, slang and unscripted language can create issues with handling the information.
Nevertheless, the greatest challenge for conversation AI is the human factor in the language fed in.
Thus, before onboarding a conversation AI, ensure the tool is capable of jumping these hurdles and having minimum defects in the language area.
To actually benefit from using conversation AI, you need to understand how to harness the best out of the tool.
Here are three tips you can follow to optimize conversation intelligence platform to get the maximum benefits out of the tool -
Customer-facing conversations are incredibly helpful for any organization, but without a tool like conversation intelligence platform to mine them, it’s extremely hard to gain any value from these assets.
While CI tools help to solve these challenges seamlessly, it is also important to realize that to drive real business value, sales leaders need to create meaningful lessons and learn at scale.
Conversation intelligence software is the right answer to this.
In addition, it is also vital to pick the right conversation AI tool to facilitate high business value, deliver coachable moments and provide personalized coaching for sales reps that are struggling, automate mundane tasks, and so much more.
Salesken’s conversation AI brings the latest and best of artificial intelligence and data science to understand a conversation deeply. Unlike chatbots, Salesken’s conversation AI can understand the intent, with multiple implications - intent, tone, sentiment, and readiness to buy.
A chatbot can never understand if the customer was happy or not, but with Salesken’s emotion detection engine can help identify if your lead was satisfied with the answer provided to any objection and also share the best responses that can influence your lead’s mind.

A strong coaching process helps, but it can only go so far without the aid of the right tools for real-time support.
Conversation technology uses AI to analyze sales conversations and provides reactive and proactive cues to the sales rep in easy, digestible formats with the correct talking points such as -
Conversation AI assists sales reps to answer such objections in a structured manner.
It turns pesky rejections as signs for improvement, delays in responses will be seen as an entity to categorize issues and assign a relevant sales rep, and more.
Sales teams are always performing routine administrative tasks and check-ups.
According to Salesforce, sales reps spend only 34% of their time in actual selling.
Not only are they spending the majority of their time in non-selling activities, because these tasks are manual, there are high chances of making human errors that often go unnoticed.
Conversation intelligence platforms are optimal to not just free up sales reps’ time but also drastically reduce human errors by automating recurring processes.
This process optimization enhances the value of every sales transaction by cutting sales time in half.
Most sales organizations invest millions in digital sales technology, often implementing disparate systems which may or may not contribute to the revenue engine.
When salestech tools do not integrate with existing systems, data usually sits in a dark box preventing sales managers from accurately guessing the cracks, or overall progress of the team and deal performance.
Because these managers lack the detailed insights required for personalized coaching, reps typically are disinterested and regard coaching as generic and unimportant.
Conversation AI tools such as Salesken provides a robust solution that aids sales managers with instant access during sales meetings to provide individual, personalized feedback.
Data such as feedback on meetings, talking points, improvisation, and more can be accessed by a single click which allows for directly referenceable, coachable moments derived from real-time moments.
Conversation intelligence also eliminates the surprise element in critical sales calls by bringing up call summaries, key takeaways, action items, and course-corrects you with reactive and proactive cues.
With quick access to action items, summaries, call snippets, and other coachable moments, sales reps can mitigate risks early on, effectively keeping track of the deal.
Modern, powerful AI tools are incrementally more capable than just pre-defined answers by delivering trends, compelling moments, daily notifications to managers and reps’ inboxes.
Although conversations are the best avenue to extract learnings for sales conversations, there are a couple of challenges when it comes to implementing conversation AI.
Unlike other salestech software, conversation intelligence is a blue ocean with a limited number of players acing the niche. Despite the low density, it’s still challenging to rely independently on the tool.
Here are 3 challenges of levering conversation intelligent software -
Although conversation AI tools are getting progressively simple to use, there are still some difficulties that can be defeated to expand the number of useful use-cases adopted by sales individuals, who are open to using the technology.
Thus, instructing your user based on opportunities can enable the tool to be easily adopted across the organization and make a better experience for individuals who are not comfortable using it.
With voice assistants and a software that basically translates your sales conversations and records it, it is of utmost priority to safeguard the organization’s privacy.
Organizations characterizing these channels must be conveyed to the clients to establish a foundation of trust and high-security norms must be put in place, particularly while performing sensitive individual data.
Conversation AI tools must be planned with security in mind to guarantee the protection.
Only opt for tools that are GDPR compliant and have high-security norms in place to avoid being a victim of phishing and hacking.
Regardless of the voice of input being voice or text, language input can be a difficult area for conversation intelligence tools.
Various dialects and background noise can directly affect the effectiveness of the conversation AI’s capability to comprehend the raw input. In addition, slang and unscripted language can create issues with handling the information.
Nevertheless, the greatest challenge for conversation AI is the human factor in the language fed in.
Thus, before onboarding a conversation AI, ensure the tool is capable of jumping these hurdles and having minimum defects in the language area.
To actually benefit from using conversation AI, you need to understand how to harness the best out of the tool.
Here are three tips you can follow to optimize conversation intelligence platform to get the maximum benefits out of the tool -
Customer-facing conversations are incredibly helpful for any organization, but without a tool like conversation intelligence platform to mine them, it’s extremely hard to gain any value from these assets.
While CI tools help to solve these challenges seamlessly, it is also important to realize that to drive real business value, sales leaders need to create meaningful lessons and learn at scale.
Conversation intelligence software is the right answer to this.
In addition, it is also vital to pick the right conversation AI tool to facilitate high business value, deliver coachable moments and provide personalized coaching for sales reps that are struggling, automate mundane tasks, and so much more.
Salesken’s conversation AI brings the latest and best of artificial intelligence and data science to understand a conversation deeply. Unlike chatbots, Salesken’s conversation AI can understand the intent, with multiple implications - intent, tone, sentiment, and readiness to buy.
A chatbot can never understand if the customer was happy or not, but with Salesken’s emotion detection engine can help identify if your lead was satisfied with the answer provided to any objection and also share the best responses that can influence your lead’s mind.

Conversational artificial intelligence has become a sensation in the last five years, with application almost everywhere. Although it has been around for decades, according to Google Trends, the search trends for "conversational AI" was almost nil from 2005 to 2017, but grew exponentially after that.
Conversational AI applications are growing, but what makes them a must-have in our daily lives?
In this blog post, we cover what conversational AI is, how it works, how it’s different from traditional chatbots, the benefits of conversational AI and some examples. Let's dive in.
Conversational AI is the technology that facilitates clear, human-like interactions between a human agent and the customer through speech or text.
Conversational AI technology refers to technologies such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice assistants that help provide human-like interactions by recognising patterns of speech and text input analysis and translating their meanings. They do so with the help of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
Conversational AI tools are typically used in customer-facing teams such as sales and customer success teams. They speed up and streamline answering common and complex queries and objections to provide a superior customer experience.
Conversational AI is capable of recognising patterns and making predictions every time a sales rep uses the technology and engages with customers. On the surface, conversational artificial intelligence tools sound deceptively simple. However, there are many technological components working in tandem with each other to process, accurately understand, and generate responses in a human-like interaction and provide a smooth experience to customers. Primary components include machine learning and natural language processing.
Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, made up of algorithms, features, and data sets that continuously improve to meet customer expectations. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the current method of analysing language in tandem with machine learning and deep learning. In the future, deep learning will help advance natural language understanding capabilities even further.
NLP consists of four steps: receiving input generation, analysing received input, dialogue management, and reinforcement learning.
A traditional chatbot is typically a rule-based software designed to automate recurring objections to answering frequently asked questions. Since they only serve a specific purpose, they are designed to follow a workflow designed by organisations and are relatively easy to build. On the other hand, AI chatbots do way more than merely answer FAQs. Organisations and sales leaders see them as packing a punch in terms of improving the overall customer experience.
The answer is simple: An AI chatbot allows customers to communicate with applications, websites, or devices such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and more in their own language that can be easily analysed for sales agents to deliver an appropriate response.
On the other hand, traditional chatbots aren't fully equipped with the technology to provide the same information and therefore, do little to improve customer satisfaction.
The key differences can be summarised as follows:
Whether chatting as a bot, or responding to an automated email, computers are working hard behind the scenes to interpret the customer’s input, determine an appropriate response, and respond in a human-like language.
The most well-known conversational AI examples from your everyday life include:
Here are three examples of well-known conversational AI used in businesses:
Lufthansa Group’s virtual assistants named Elisa, Nelly, and Maria help passengers by chatting with them in the event of cancelled flights or missed connections to arrive at a solution.
Their AI-powered chatbots are available around the clock for continuous support and can do more than just answer common questions.
In case the chatbot doesn’t have the best solution, it connects with the next available agent without customers having to wait in line, so they get the help they want with a single click.
Leveraging conversational AI chatbots, Lufthansa’s customer service centers have visibly reduced time spent on answering common questions. They can now focus more on enquiries that the bots are unable to answer.
Sephora was one of the first fashion retailers to roll out AI chatbots with their Kik-based chatbot to genuinely help customers that visit their online store.
Every time a new customer visits Sephora, the chatbot prompts a quiz developed to understand the customer and their choices deeply to recommend products that they might like and provide brilliant customer service.
Customers can also use the bot to book in-store services and even virtually try on various products just by uploading their selfies.
Introducing the AI-based chatbot has helped Sephora position itself as a helpful partner in their customer’s beauty journey to make it easier for customers to make easy purchasing decisions.
In the past, mental health services weren’t the most accessible and there was no guarantee that the patients would receive the help they needed.
Woebot Health, an advanced artificial intelligence-based mental health provider, practically eliminates all barriers in relation to mental health therapy, allowing people to interact with their Woebot on-demand chatbot.
The chatbot was designed by developers from Stanford to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to patients on their terms.
Woebot’s chatbot combines its intensive knowledge in psychology with advanced AI to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health needs and respond accordingly with empathy.
Users can have text conversations with the Woebot. The AI-chatbot uses therapy tools centring around the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). The bot also offers psychoeducation and helps users address their mental health issues.
Users can leverage the capabilities of Woebot at any given time, convenient to them, and can receive meaningful insights to help them work through their issues.
There are four primary types of conversational AI:
Let us look at each in detail:
Chatbots are software programs that mimic a human conversation with a customer via messaging. Several types of chatbots follow a rule-driven, or natural language processing system to help customers.
Some of the types of chatbots include:
Their applications are vast and leveraged across a multitude of sectors like banking, retail, e-commerce, real estate, and more.
Rule-based chatbots have a less flexible, conversational flow and can be predictable. They cannot answer any questions outside of the defined rules. Some advantages of a rule-based chatbot are:
On the other hand, conversational AI chatbots learn the context and intent of the question with natural training. AI chatbots generate their answers mimicking an actual human agent using natural-language responses. The more you use and train them, the more they learn. Some of the advantages of conversational AI chatbots are:
Voice assistants are the technologies that convert voice commands into machine-readable text to recognise the voice of the customer and the intent behind it to perform the programmed task. For example, a sales manager can ask the digital assistant to fetch a relevant deal file without searching for this information manually.
Some of the benefits of voice assistants include:
An interactive voice assistant or IVA is an automated phone system technology that allows incoming callers to interact with a computer-operated system via voice or keypad input.
Interactive voice assistants are used across industries like retail, banking, utilities, travel, and weather. Some of the advantages include:
Virtual assistants are some of the common applications of conversational AI, but the technology can offer so much more for you and your business. Virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, or Cortana include a vital component that helps people – machine learning.
Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence application that focuses on training systems to improve their ability to learn to perform tasks better, or interact better with humans. This is achieved by feeding data to computer systems to analyse patterns and guide future decisions automatically. The most exciting part of this technology is that the machine can learn itself without being programmed by humans, allowing them to develop more advanced capabilities.
So, every time a virtual assistant makes a mistake while responding to your query, it leverages this information to learn from and correct its mistake in the future.
Some of the benefits include the possibility of omnichannel deployment, lower development costs, and that it’s capable of learning on its own.
Conversational AI offers plenty of benefits for businesses every day, right from lead generation to lead prioritisation to even team coaching. Here are some ways businesses can benefit from leveraging conversational AI:
For most sales organisations, higher call volumes are part of the new reality. Conversational AI, virtual assistants, and chatbots are the best AI for sales as they help resolve low-value calls and relieve harried customer-facing teams during increased call spikes.
With conversational AI, sales teams can categorise calls based on what the customer needs, their past interactions with the brand, and their emotions, intent, and sentiment. Common interactional queries can be routed through an intelligent virtual assistant, thus lowering the costs of high-touch interactions while also focusing on high-value conversations that convert.
Modern-day customers have high expectations and a myriad of options to choose from. Conversational AI can help businesses with a competitive advantage by driving better targeting and conversion rates for both marketing and sales teams such as alerting agents about the best time to make sales calls, follow up, or respond to queries.
AI-based chatbots can help businesses understand their buyers better, their preferences, where they hang out, and other relevant information tailored to their personality to pitch accordingly.
Conversational AI creates meaningful and personalised customer insights for sales members to accommodate their customers’ emotions, intent, and sentiments.
Not all tasks require human effort.
Conversational AI can help sales agents resolve low-effort emails and calls and repeated processes such as sifting through data and feeding them into CRMs. This helps free up customer service teams so they can focus on conversations that may convert.
By automating these bulk sets of tasks, conversational AI can drastically reduce operational costs for customer service teams and errors associated with human data entry. In addition, the technology can help uncover vital insights that can sometimes slip through the crack by sales teams.
Conversational AI is growing at a massive scale with each passing day and for a good reason.
Organisations are increasingly beginning to leverage the technology to improve their customer support, customer experience, instill team coaching, visibility into the deal pipeline, and more.
There is an inherent demand for effortless, immediate resolutions and technologies that can be established to improve intra-teams across channels. Even one bad experience can turn someone off from doing business with your organisation.
As customer expectations rise exponentially, conversational AI can assist sales teams to deliver highly consistent customer service at scale.
Salesken’s conversational AI brings you the best and the latest technologies revolving around artificial intelligence to deliver a superior customer experience. Salesken’s emotion detection engine can identify your customers’ needs and help identify their satisfaction levels with reactive and proactive cues.
Salesken’s AI chatbot works beyond traditional chatbot’s capabilities to understand the customer’s intent, emotion, and sentiment.
‍Book a demo with our sales expert to explore the capabilities of conversational AI to watch the magic unfold.
The simplest example of a conversational AI is a voice assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant which you may have interacted with in the past. These voice assistants provide you with the best answers in response to a human query, mimicking human-like language.
Conversational AI does not rely on manually written scripts to answer customer queries. The technology enables businesses to automate highly personalised customer resolutions at scale, making every interaction unique and relevant, while reducing effort and resolution time.
Conversational interactions are the interactions conducted in a dialogical way by exchanging messages in a natural, human-like language.

Interactive voice assistants are used across industries like retail, banking, utilities, travel, and weather. Some of the advantages include:
Virtual assistants are some of the common applications of conversational AI, but the technology can offer so much more for you and your business. Virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, or Cortana include a vital component that helps people – machine learning.
Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence application that focuses on training systems to improve their ability to learn to perform tasks better, or interact better with humans. This is achieved by feeding data to computer systems to analyse patterns and guide future decisions automatically. The most exciting part of this technology is that the machine can learn itself without being programmed by humans, allowing them to develop more advanced capabilities.
So, every time a virtual assistant makes a mistake while responding to your query, it leverages this information to learn from and correct its mistake in the future.
Some of the benefits include the possibility of omnichannel deployment, lower development costs, and that it’s capable of learning on its own.
Conversational AI offers plenty of benefits for businesses every day, right from lead generation to lead prioritisation to even team coaching. Here are some ways businesses can benefit from leveraging conversational AI:
For most sales organisations, higher call volumes are part of the new reality. Conversational AI, virtual assistants, and chatbots are the best AI for sales as they help resolve low-value calls and relieve harried customer-facing teams during increased call spikes.
With conversational AI, sales teams can categorise calls based on what the customer needs, their past interactions with the brand, and their emotions, intent, and sentiment. Common interactional queries can be routed through an intelligent virtual assistant, thus lowering the costs of high-touch interactions while also focusing on high-value conversations that convert.
Modern-day customers have high expectations and a myriad of options to choose from. Conversational AI can help businesses with a competitive advantage by driving better targeting and conversion rates for both marketing and sales teams such as alerting agents about the best time to make sales calls, follow up, or respond to queries.
AI-based chatbots can help businesses understand their buyers better, their preferences, where they hang out, and other relevant information tailored to their personality to pitch accordingly.
Conversational AI creates meaningful and personalised customer insights for sales members to accommodate their customers’ emotions, intent, and sentiments.
Not all tasks require human effort.
Conversational AI can help sales agents resolve low-effort emails and calls and repeated processes such as sifting through data and feeding them into CRMs. This helps free up customer service teams so they can focus on conversations that may convert.
By automating these bulk sets of tasks, conversational AI can drastically reduce operational costs for customer service teams and errors associated with human data entry. In addition, the technology can help uncover vital insights that can sometimes slip through the crack by sales teams.
Conversational AI is growing at a massive scale with each passing day and for a good reason.
Organisations are increasingly beginning to leverage the technology to improve their customer support, customer experience, instill team coaching, visibility into the deal pipeline, and more.
There is an inherent demand for effortless, immediate resolutions and technologies that can be established to improve intra-teams across channels. Even one bad experience can turn someone off from doing business with your organisation.
As customer expectations rise exponentially, conversational AI can assist sales teams to deliver highly consistent customer service at scale.
Salesken’s conversational AI brings you the best and the latest technologies revolving around artificial intelligence to deliver a superior customer experience. Salesken’s emotion detection engine can identify your customers’ needs and help identify their satisfaction levels with reactive and proactive cues.
Salesken’s AI chatbot works beyond traditional chatbot’s capabilities to understand the customer’s intent, emotion, and sentiment.
‍Book a demo with our sales expert to explore the capabilities of conversational AI to watch the magic unfold.
The simplest example of a conversational AI is a voice assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant which you may have interacted with in the past. These voice assistants provide you with the best answers in response to a human query, mimicking human-like language.
Conversational AI does not rely on manually written scripts to answer customer queries. The technology enables businesses to automate highly personalised customer resolutions at scale, making every interaction unique and relevant, while reducing effort and resolution time.
Conversational interactions are the interactions conducted in a dialogical way by exchanging messages in a natural, human-like language.

The only way to stand out in today’s extremely competitive business landscape is by creating an exceptional customer experience. For this, you need a unique tool to exceed customers’ expectations through a remarkable customer journey. The best way to do this is through in-depth customer insights.
This article will explain why the strategic application of customer insights can help you stay ahead in the competitive business ecosystem.
Let’s get started!
Customer insights are all about deriving apt interpretations of different types of consumer data, including consumer behaviour and feedback, to develop products and improve customer journeys.
These customer insights help businesses to develop a 360-degree overview of customers’ expectations. Furthermore, these insights help them understand how they can position their products and services based on customers’ preferences.
You can find answers to the following questions with the sales growth insights:
In today’s digital landscape, there are multiple sources from which to derive customer insights, including CRM software, customer feedback, cookies, purchase reviews, sentiment analysis and more.
Customer insights are your key route to building relationships with consumers. It can help you leverage customers’ behaviour and activities to strengthen customer relationships. Here are some of the major benefits of harnessing customer insights:
There are some KPIs that every business must track. Two of those KPIs are customer churn rate and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Customer churn rate estimates how many customers you are losing on. Ideally, this KPI has to increase. With proper consumer insights, businesses can identify the main touchpoints responsible for causing high churn rates and adjust customer service accordingly.
CLV, on the other hand, represents how strongly a brand is associated with its existing customers. It is no secret that it takes lesser efforts to retain an existing customer than acquiring new customers. With consumer insights and market research, businesses can plan an apt strategy to maintain high CLV.
When you have the required consumer insights, you can easily deliver an exceptional customer journey. That’s because you have all the resources to personalise customers’ journeys. It is extremely important to offer a personalised user journey in today’s landscape as 80% of customers expect it from the brands. With consumer insights, you can offer customers a much-needed customised experience.
Suppose you want to improve the performance of your sales team. You can leverage consumer insights to achieve that. Use a powerful, AI-driven speech analytics solution like SalesKen that provides actionable insights by analysing conversations in real-time. It provides strategic suggestions on improvement areas to form better sales pitches.
Harnessing consumer insights like sales data can improve your inventory workflow. It helps you make an accurate prediction of your existing inventories. That way, you’ll have a deeper idea of the current inventory level and when you need to restock. Hence, consumer insights can save you from overstocking and understocking based on consumers’ demands.
Consumer insights can be of different types. Here are the different types of customer insights that you should know of:
By “usage information,” we mean all kinds of customer behaviour data, including product and service usage data. These datasets can help you identify the frequency of using your products, the pattern of usage, and other relevant sales growth insights.
Businesses can generate customer service data from the multiple interactions between customer service teams and customers. You can access some of the most critical datasets from this source, including customers’ knowledge of your product, their feedback if there are any issues, and so on.
Firmographic data is a critical data source for consumer insights, especially for B2B businesses. It includes information like the location of customers, industry type, etc. Businesses can use this information to create an ideal buyer persona.
Competitor data is about identifying which strategies the competitors are using and how you can leverage them to position your products better. You can access these datasets through in-depth market and competitor research.
The purpose of collecting this data is to understand how satisfied the customers are with your products and services. Brands most commonly use Net Promoter Score (NPS) to estimate customer loyalty. The idea is to share a quick survey with the customers to determine if they’re happy enough to recommend your products to others.
Here are some ways to collect customer insights to expedite business performance:
One of the major sources of collecting customer insights is through a speech analytics solution like SalesKen. Once this tool can access conversations between customers and reps, it can do the following:
A popular way to gain consumer insights is through A/B testing. A/B testing is an experimental approach where you can try different strategies and finalise on anyone based on customers’ responses.
For instance, suppose you’re building a new sales process. Before making any final decisions, you need to identify which sales process will suit your customers’ journey the most! With A/B testing, you can try both ways and see which one entices more customers through the sales growth insights. Accordingly, you can select any one sales approach.
Do you use a chatbot for prompt customer communication? Well, it can do more than just customer interactions. It can be a great source of customer insights for your brand. Some of the useful insights that you can get from chatbot are as follows:
Make sure that you use these consumer insights to attain as much information about customers as possible.
Customer sentiment surveys help you gain actionable insights into customers’ emotions. Instead of asking questions, you need to add options to like/dislike emoji-based reactions in these surveys. It is a good way to check your brand’s NPS and understand how well the customers will recommend your products to others. Brands can make these surveys more in-depth with more feature-centric questions.
Let’s discuss how data-driven customer insights can boost sales for your organisation:
Ideally, marketing and sales teams should go hand in hand to boost profit margins. But does that happen very often? Not really! Marketing and sales teams often report a huge communication gap that can affect the company’s financial performance.
By collecting customer insights, businesses can bridge that gap. With useful sales growth insights, both teams will get the necessary input on continuing their activities. Customer insights can streamline the activities of marketing and sales teams and help them make the right business decisions.
Businesses are always trying to build more and more customer-focused strategies. For that, they must gather more insights into customers’ activities. The more you know about the customers, the easier it is to build convertible customer conversion strategies.
Remember that 47% of users define “trustworthiness” as an imperative criterion for sales reps.
To win customers’ trust and to offer them a personalised customer journey, it is a must that you gain real-time customer insights. That way, closing sales deals will become a lot easier for your sales team!
Consumer insights can find key traits from your target users. These traits can include their age, location, profession, and any other useful data to create the appropriate buyer persona. This means you can now understand what your target customers are expecting from the brand, and accordingly, you can build stellar marketing strategies to create a personalised customer journey.
Customer insights are all about understanding your customers better and providing them with what they’re looking for. We hope you have a detailed understanding of customer insights and their usefulness by now. So, what are you waiting for?

In 2022, artificial intelligence is everywhere. In our personal lives, conversation intelligence platforms such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa carefully analyse our voice input and provide appropriate solutions for us. They make everyday tasks like ordering food, commuting and getting work done much easier.
Now, imagine this technology being leveraged for sales teams.
Every customer conversation is loaded with deep insights that could transform your sales team, strategy, and quality of service. Businesses globally use conversation analytics software (also called conversation intelligence software) to analyse customer conversations, understand their intent, customer behaviour, and more.
But first, let's understand how conversation intelligence and conversation analytics software work, and how they can help you understand your customers on a deeper level.
Conversation analytics or conversation intelligence is the process of understanding customer phone calls to uncover critical insights about the conversation by recording and transcribing call data.
Conversation analytics is the term used to describe the process of using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to extract data from a sales conversation. This conversation data is then processed by artificial intelligence to understand how the customers feel and to deliver an appropriate response.
Conversation analytics software comes with a myriad of benefits, like understanding deal intelligence, call data, and how to steer the tone of the conversation.
Conversational intelligence, (or conversation analytics software) requires several entities to turn customer conversations into actionable data.
A conversation intelligence platform like Salesken gathers important data via a sophisticated AI algorithm, machine learning, and NLP.
The technology is leveraged to transcribe every call recording, chat, and more to deep dive into sales data analysis and understand customer behaviour.
A conversation analytics software typically comprises of a transcription engine, a query and a search user interface to allow the user to define requirements and carry out search reporting applications to present the analytics via keyword analysis, and business applications to improve customer experience.
While this may sound complicated, the software transcribes call data, and scores them in real-time, allowing sales reps to learn about the prospect and their inclination towards the product in minutes.
Sales teams receive an ocean of data, which when leveraged correctly, can be efficiently used for conversions and attributions.
Here are four benefits of using conversation AI:
Several organisations struggle to understand the customer even when they are much deeper in the deal cycle. Despite how crucial it is to get actionable insights to deliver a better customer experience, this factor is often overlooked, or perhaps, not given enough importance.
Customer intelligence analytics helps you deliver insights to gain a leg up on your competition. It assists your sales teams to improve their product by understanding every step of the customer journey.
The technology focuses on customer sentiment, intent, and objections, so you have a more meaningful conversation by learning continuously from customer interactions. It also delivers actionable insights into your customer experience through phone calls, chatbots, and other digital experiences.
Being able to assist your sales reps in real-time is an extremely beneficial feature because it teaches reps how to improve their approach and also delivers a better experience for your customers.
Conversation analytics provides real-time cues on live phone calls to keep sales reps from fumbling. It provides an enhanced sales experience overall by answering the customers’ queries better.
A good conversation analytics platform should be able to flag issues and get the sales manager’s attention.
With conversation analytics, it gets easier to analyse every sales rep’s conversation and determine their performance with call reports that jot down intricate details.
These reports can be leveraged by sales managers to understand areas that need improvement and those that do not to help sales reps get on track with their peers.
Customer churn is one of the biggest worries of all organisations across the globe.
The lower your churn rate is, the better it is for your organisation. Conversation analytics can help you get there with its revenue intelligence feature.
For instance, if you notice a trend in your customers asking for refunds and cancellation of subscriptions, the software can help you track such keywords every time it comes up in a conversation.
Collate such requests to understand the event and the reason that led to the customer asking for a refund. From there, uncover these insights to pinpoint common issues that cause customer churn and come up with a sales strategy to tackle them going forward.
As mentioned earlier, conversation analytics makes it easy to flag objections, raise issues, and improve problem areas.
Another benefit of using the technology is that sales reps can leverage the data uncovered from deals to categorise their learnings and re-route their strategies to sell better and close deals faster.
For instance, you can review your agent’s calls and understand their strengths and weaknesses to tailor their approach effectively.
The report produced can also be used to coach sales reps that are struggling to close deals and point out areas that need improvement.
Use conversation analytics to allocate agents in call queues that are more relevant to their skill sets and knowledge expertise to deliver a better customer experience.
The conversation data you gather using the conversation analytics software can help you improve your call metrics, sales strategy, and more. Below are five use-cases for conversation analytics:
Some customers are extremely voiceful about their needs, objections, and fears, while some aren’t.
With the speech analytics software, understanding the intent behind the customer’s voice becomes easy. Although your lead score might be good, sometimes, the signs may slip through the crack.
Conversation analytics help you tackle the discrepancies by pinpointing the exact cause for deal rejections, or hesitancy, creating deeper connections between the customer’s intent and the sales rep, and understanding their behaviour better.
The technology picks up these signs and helps sales teams to analyse the information and dive deep with emergency responses that are showcased during a live sales call to assist sales reps to handle objections better.
Sales reps typically drown in a pool of data that mostly goes in a dark folder in the cloud. To supercharge any sales deal, it is crucial to understand and predict the customer’s future behaviour to tailor the pitch accordingly. Conversation analytics is just the right technology you need to drive such business interactions.
For instance, let’s say you are launching a new product feature, which is a part of the best-selling product. You’re aware that the product is doing extremely well, but an existing customer has identified a substantial problem in your product, and now, this is a huge roadblock in your new product feature.
Without conversation analytics, it becomes extremely difficult to track every customer’s feedback manually, both online and offline, which eventually puts off new buyers from purchasing your product.
Conversation analytics software triggers a sales rep every time a customer leaves negative feedback on your service tickets. Instead of finding out the hard way about your product’s shortcomings, keep an eye on the feedback given by the customer via service tickets and tackle the issue before disasters happen.
No sales team in any organisation has perfected sales without external help.
At any sales organisation, sales managers need to understand who their top-performers, mid, and bottom performers are to sell better.
Coaching is an integral part of sales.
Identifying sales reps that consistently fail to deliver successful outcomes helps the team to perform better.
Conversation analytics helps sales managers identify mid and bottom performers and tailor their coaching to assist them. Without the technology, it becomes increasingly difficult for sales managers to understand why certain reps need coaching.
Conversation intelligence software’s call tracking metrics collate and analyse top sales reps’ conversations and summarise the best takeaways to promote peer learning.
Regardless of the industry you operate in, every organisation needs a loyal customer base and a strong online reputation.
However, managing business operations manually while keeping up with constant chatter and trends is tricky. Leveraging trends to deliver a better customer experience is also taxing.
Conversation analytics grabs such trends and records them in a single place for sales reps to refer to during live sales conversations, highlighted by the customers. The technology triggers keywords during a sales call and alerts the sales rep to improvise the pitch and help the sales rep close the deal.
Conversation intelligence software also called revenue intelligence does way more than just coaching and alerting sales reps to improvise their sales pitches.
The conversation analytics tool gathers insights by sifting through calls, identifies opportunities within the call, tracks the tone and sentiment of the customer, and provides a holistic score to help sales agents understand and focus their attention on prospects that are moving down the funnel.
Sales reps can also identify prospects that need more convincing with the help of conversation analytics to provide the right kind of assistance such as sharing a relevant blog post, testimonial, or even case study.
With revenue intelligence, you can understand what deals are working for you, why, and the ones that need a little push with the right kind of cues and lead scores.
Did you know that 81% of customers prefer calling companies regularly as opposed to sending emails, or having online chats?
Typically, most brands don’t find it challenging to understand their customer needs and can easily quantify data coming from emails, or chats. But unfortunately, the same does not apply to phone calls.
Conversation analytics bridges the gap between the customer and the sales agent by turning the plethora of data shared in the conversation into actionable insights that allow sales teams to compare calls and understand where their deal stands.
With the conversation analytics software, sales reps can easily score conversations, spot trends and prioritise leads without even listening to all calls.
Tools such as Salesken make it easy to glance at key information to understand which leads are qualified when leads convert, and what needs to be done to propel the conversation forward.
Conversation analytics software removes the guesswork and provides sales teams with deep insights designed for successful outcomes, and helps sales managers coach their team to improve their performance and productivity.
Conversation analytics help you get more out of your customer data.
With better attribution and tailored insights, sales teams can get maximum benefits out of the tool and get a more accurate sense of deals, agent performance and revenue intelligence based on actual KPIs and metrics.
Conversation analytics software such as Salesken provide the best and the latest artificial intelligence technology to help sales teams recognise their deals, provide superior customer experience, and coach team members seamlessly.

Businesses across the world are investing aggressively in innovation. That’s undoubtedly a good thing! However, companies must focus on understanding customers’ needs to build a customer-centric innovation strategy that’s truly impactful.
A customer-focused approach can help organisations take impactful action based on customers’ requirements.
Leveraging your customer needs is the secret to satisfied customers and ultimately to your business success. This article will help you better identify and understand customer needs and leverage them to make a difference.
Let’s get started!
A customer need is a demand or requirement that prompts a customer to purchase a product or service. It is the key driver that directs the purchase decision-making process for the customer. For businesses, understanding customer needs can open doors to new opportunities.
Let’s simplify this with an example where you are the customer. Suppose you’re leading a project for your company, and you observe that everything is disoriented. You immediately feel the need to organise the project, break it down into tasks and sub-tasks, and allocate responsibilities to different employees. So your primary need here is to organise the project, followed by several secondary needs.
A customer-centric company would correctly understand your needs and recommend project management software that can satisfy your primary need of getting more organised. It will ideally also satisfy any key secondary needs. So it is clear that if a business wants to provide the customers (in this case, you) with an optimum solution, they need to be clear about the customer’s needs.
76% of customers expect that organisations will realise their needs and offer them solutions accordingly.
It should not go the other way round, where they have a product that satisfies some generic need and try to force-fit your needs to their product.
It is impossible to list down all customer needs. Customer needs can depend on the industry, brand, customers’ demographics, and numerous other factors. However, here are a few of the common customer needs that we listed down:
But then again, these are just a few generic, fundamental customer needs and wants. There are many more and tend to be quite specific to the customer and their context.
Wondering how you can identify customer needs? Here are some of the easiest ways to do that:
Customers need analysis is the process of performing in-depth analysis on customers to understand their needs. It tends to figure out how the attributes and features of the product can add value to the customers. Marketers often run surveys in their target market to get a closer look at customers’ needs.
Here are some questions that can be part of such surveys:
All these datasets can help you clarify customer needs and ensure that your strategy is aligned with their requirements.
You can also create a customer needs statement that covers all the critical aspects to serve customer needs. It can be a valuable document for your sales and marketing teams to plan their actions better.
Here’s what you can include within a customer needs statement:
You can start collecting more relevant data and add those to your value statements to understand the customers better. In fact, you can add more sections to the statement. This is only a structure to get you started.
The means-end analysis survey capitalises on the data you collect through a customer needs analysis survey. It helps you get the bigger picture of what customers are looking for and how you can stand out in the crowd by offering them their requirements.
A means analysis statement analyses each customer's response to figure out what the customers need and why they need it. Once you have the reasons behind customer needs, you can divide them into the following three sections:
‍The features or attributes can be a major driving factor behind a customer’s purchase decision. It is the features that can distinguish your products and services from that of the competitors.
‍Can the customer acquire any benefit from buying the product or service? Make a note of customers’ perceived benefits and understand if that’s enough!
‍Is your product or service adding enough value to the customer? This is a crucial part as it can make or break the entire deal. So, keep track of it.
So what after you have a good understanding of customer needs? Is that enough? Not really! As soon as you know what the customers are demanding, it’s time to take action. Here are some quick, easy tips to help you meet customer demand:

Brands should always make it a point to address each customer feedback and review it seriously. Pay special attention to repeat feedback. Rather than considering these as criticism, you should look at these reviews as opportunities to improve customers’ needs.
To keep track of customer service, brands must build a feedback loop. Such a loop should include several phases like surveys, interviews, polls, satisfaction scores, and proper channels to address those.
A regular look at the feedback loop can help your brand identify even minor technical glitches in the products and services. This will only save your time, cost, and efforts in the long run.
Businesses can also use speech analytics software like Salesken to analyse the conversation between sales reps and customers and discover real-time conversation cues. You can get developed insights into your sales pipeline and learn how to use it better.
A speech analytics software can help you understand customer needs better and help your reps with proper improvement areas to create better sales pitches. Investing in speech analytics software can be highly profitable for businesses in the long run.
Swift customer service may not always be a customer need, but working on it can have long-term advantages. Stay empathetic to customers and automate your customer support workflow to respond quickly.
Businesses can use different customer service channels like emails, social media, virtual assistants, and chat to respond to customer queries promptly.
Businesses should make sure that they are giving out the right messaging through their sales pitches. Many a time, sales reps are confused about how to communicate with the prospects. As a result, different sales reps use different takeaway messages in their cold calling scripts.
When reps are clueless about the organisation’s vision and values, they’ll obviously give the wrong message to the customers. As a result, customers will face ambiguities. Furthermore, there’s a good chance that customer needs will go unaddressed after conversion.
So, the best way is to set an organisation-wide common message. It should be the same for every employee, especially the sales and marketing professionals. That way, it will be easier to serve customer needs.
Brands should always make it a point to maintain long-term customer relationships. Proactive relationship building is a sign of long-term customer satisfaction. Brands can either complete a one-time purchase and let the customer churn out or keep communicating with the customer to ensure they keep buying from you.
The way to interact with customers says a lot about your brand. There is nothing like it if you can nurture the customers with timely customer service and support activities.
Identifying customer needs is not as easy as it sounds. Even a minor mistake can mess up the entire strategy. It is better to know about these common mistakes beforehand:
Every business has its list of loyal customers. These are the frequent buyers who prefer your services to competitor services and recommend your offerings to others. However, businesses often make the mistake of relying on these A-listers for every single purpose. In fact, even when they’re conducting a customer needs analysis survey, their only hope is these A-listers.
This is a critical mistake that any business can make. The A-listers are already biased toward your services. Their opinion can be repetitive and won’t make much difference in your customer needs analysis survey. So, it is always good to move beyond the A-listers and interact with others to understand customer needs.
If you’re accepting vague responses from customers as major data points, you’re making a mistake! Customers’ responses may include many generic inputs that don’t really make sense in a needs analysis.
The only acceptable responses should be the specific ones that clearly detect customer needs. If open-ended questions are creating confusion, businesses can go for close-ended surveys. You can provide the customers with common need factors like customer support, pricing, features, etc., and record their needs on a pre-defined measurement scale.
While performing a customer needs analysis survey, you must ask the right set of questions. The focus areas of these questions should be product or service features and what else the customers are looking for. Businesses often ask customers for the solution, but that’s a mistake. Customers can help you point out the problems. But it is your responsibility to go to the core and find out a feasible solution to this problem. If you accept the customer’s solution, it can be a short-term fix, but the problem can still arise in the long run. So, beware!
The purpose of the sales discovery process is to know the prospects better, understand their pain points, and then pitch the right products and services to them. Ideally, sales discovery is a multi-stage process that involves in-depth research. The key to an effective sales discovery process is proper customer needs analysis. This ensures that the reps are properly aware of the prospects and their requirements and are ready to convert them with sure-fire strategies.
Understanding customer needs can help your brand in several ways. The sooner a business can master the art of customer needs analysis, the better. Remember that customer needs analysis is a difficult process with several steps. Following the above steps will help you get it right in the most efficient way possible.

Conversation intelligence (AI) entails a myriad of innovations ranging from automated chat workflows to two-way SMS to virtual assistants - this technology is evolving rapidly.
With each passing day, an increasing number of sales organizations are leveraging the technology to assist their teams better, and therefore, sell better.
So, how do you utilize the best of AI/ML in sales?
Let’s dive in.
Conversation intelligence or conversation AI is a form of technology that combines the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with traditional software such as chatbots, voice assistants, or interactive voice recognition software to assist customers.
Conversational intelligence is the technology behind speech-enabled applications that offer human-like interactions to the customer.
Though chatbots have gained immense popularity in the last decade, they also have all repute commonly for not thoroughly understanding the customer intent and providing bot-like answers.
The best conversational intelligence software offers a solution that is indistinguishable to recognize and will replicate an actual sales rep, provides end-to-end support to sales teams to move the deal further in the funnel, and more.
Conversational intelligence is one of the ways sales organizations can entirely be transformed in the coming future. Here are six ways how the technology can reshape sales -
Sales reps spend about 8.8 hours a week searching for information about their prospects and 32% of their overall time trying to fill data in their CRM system.
Even if you are using a CRM system such as Salesforce, oftentimes, sales reps do not enter all the information in an organized way. As a sales manager, no data or inaccurate data insinuates that the information is inaccurate, leading to roadblocks in the pipeline and an inaccurate representation of the same.
Sometimes, this can also pose a major challenge for new turn-ins.
Suppose a sales rep is handing over the deal to a new rep, they may not be fully aware of the context, and what has already been shared with the customer to move forward.
Instead of building rapport and taking the deal forward, the new rep may have to spend hours together to be at pace with the old rep and learn about the prospect from scratch.
This is where conversational intelligence can help.
The technology automatically records every customer conversation, transcribes them into bite-sized chunks, summarizes key takeaways and automatically feeds into the CRM, so the sales rep is always updated.
As your organization starts to grow on a positive trajectory, it is vital to have top-performing sales members in your team.
Unfortunately, not everyone is born a top performer. Some team members learn on the go and some have to be coached from winning strategies.
Grooming sales reps without having a benchmark is difficult for sales managers.
Enabling conversational intelligence in your sales organization with the right tools eases the process and makes it seamless to conduct team reviews, 1:1s with team members, and even create a sales playbook with the best practices.
Conversational intelligence allows your sales teams to recognize their shortcomings on sales conversations, discuss, brainstorm, and also review your team’s overall performance to point out what went wrong and what can be improved.
Share peer learnings and best practices across the organization to replicate winning strategies.
Getting new salespersons at par with your organization and bringing them to speed is critical for every organization.
Onboarding is a vital part of every organization. Establishing a hassle-free onboarding flow not only determines the efficiency of your product but also sets the path to your organization’s culture.
To set up your organization for success, getting the onboarding process right is the answer.
Conversational intelligence can assist your managers in not only setting up a smooth onboarding workflow but also establishing a great work culture.
The technology records the best sales training ideas of your top-performing reps, creates a library of your onboarding process in a clean but bite-sized workflow for reps to understand, and replicates winning strategies.
Without conversational intelligence, sales managers can struggle with inconsistent training, have loopholes in the onboarding, and battle with their processes, often not leading to success.
Sales teams spend about 30% of their time understanding key takeaways from sales conversations, which involve mundane tasks like taking notes.
Automating note-taking with conversational intelligence can help the team actually focus better on the conversation and ask better qualifying questions as opposed to juggling a myriad of tasks manually.
Conversational intelligence automates the entire process of note-taking and also, helps you organize the data into a dashboard around key triggers.
With regular feedback, the technology improves itself to give you better suggestions, cues, potential risks, and answers to objections during a live sales call to help close the deal faster.
Automation also ensures that reps can tag relevant sales managers to assess the situation, tracks vital information over time, and triggers the rep for the next steps.
Another area where AI can be extremely useful is sales call analytics.
Conversational intelligence can be used in a number of ways to obtain insights about sales effectiveness and call performance.
Some of the most common areas where conversational intelligence can be helpful are -
Evaluates signals to help you understand where the deal currently stands and how to go about it.
Receive actionable insights and cues on deals and accounts, and how to answer specific objections, qualifiable questions, and more.
Recognize best practices with reference to previous sales calls within each stage of the sales lifecycle to push a deal faster in the pipeline.
Track win rates, understand win vs loss rates against competitors, how your organization stands out from the crowd, and more.

Conversation intelligence (AI) entails a myriad of innovations ranging from automated chat workflows to two-way SMS to virtual assistants - this technology is evolving rapidly.
With each passing day, an increasing number of sales organizations are leveraging the technology to assist their teams better, and therefore, sell better.
So, how do you utilize the best of AI/ML in sales?
Let’s dive in.
Conversation intelligence or conversation AI is a form of technology that combines the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with traditional software such as chatbots, voice assistants, or interactive voice recognition software to assist customers.
Conversational intelligence is the technology behind speech-enabled applications that offer human-like interactions to the customer.
Though chatbots have gained immense popularity in the last decade, they also have all repute commonly for not thoroughly understanding the customer intent and providing bot-like answers.
The best conversational intelligence software offers a solution that is indistinguishable to recognize and will replicate an actual sales rep, provides end-to-end support to sales teams to move the deal further in the funnel, and more.
Conversational intelligence is one of the ways sales organizations can entirely be transformed in the coming future. Here are six ways how the technology can reshape sales -
Sales reps spend about 8.8 hours a week searching for information about their prospects and 32% of their overall time trying to fill data in their CRM system.
Even if you are using a CRM system such as Salesforce, oftentimes, sales reps do not enter all the information in an organized way. As a sales manager, no data or inaccurate data insinuates that the information is inaccurate, leading to roadblocks in the pipeline and an inaccurate representation of the same.
Sometimes, this can also pose a major challenge for new turn-ins.
Suppose a sales rep is handing over the deal to a new rep, they may not be fully aware of the context, and what has already been shared with the customer to move forward.
Instead of building rapport and taking the deal forward, the new rep may have to spend hours together to be at pace with the old rep and learn about the prospect from scratch.
This is where conversational intelligence can help.
The technology automatically records every customer conversation, transcribes them into bite-sized chunks, summarizes key takeaways and automatically feeds into the CRM, so the sales rep is always updated.
As your organization starts to grow on a positive trajectory, it is vital to have top-performing sales members in your team.
Unfortunately, not everyone is born a top performer. Some team members learn on the go and some have to be coached from winning strategies.
Grooming sales reps without having a benchmark is difficult for sales managers.
Enabling conversational intelligence in your sales organization with the right tools eases the process and makes it seamless to conduct team reviews, 1:1s with team members, and even create a sales playbook with the best practices.
Conversational intelligence allows your sales teams to recognize their shortcomings on sales conversations, discuss, brainstorm, and also review your team’s overall performance to point out what went wrong and what can be improved.
Share peer learnings and best practices across the organization to replicate winning strategies.
Getting new salespersons at par with your organization and bringing them to speed is critical for every organization.
Onboarding is a vital part of every organization. Establishing a hassle-free onboarding flow not only determines the efficiency of your product but also sets the path to your organization’s culture.
To set up your organization for success, getting the onboarding process right is the answer.
Conversational intelligence can assist your managers in not only setting up a smooth onboarding workflow but also establishing a great work culture.
The technology records the best sales training ideas of your top-performing reps, creates a library of your onboarding process in a clean but bite-sized workflow for reps to understand, and replicates winning strategies.
Without conversational intelligence, sales managers can struggle with inconsistent training, have loopholes in the onboarding, and battle with their processes, often not leading to success.
Sales teams spend about 30% of their time understanding key takeaways from sales conversations, which involve mundane tasks like taking notes.
Automating note-taking with conversational intelligence can help the team actually focus better on the conversation and ask better qualifying questions as opposed to juggling a myriad of tasks manually.
Conversational intelligence automates the entire process of note-taking and also, helps you organize the data into a dashboard around key triggers.
With regular feedback, the technology improves itself to give you better suggestions, cues, potential risks, and answers to objections during a live sales call to help close the deal faster.
Automation also ensures that reps can tag relevant sales managers to assess the situation, tracks vital information over time, and triggers the rep for the next steps.
Another area where AI can be extremely useful is sales call analytics.
Conversational intelligence can be used in a number of ways to obtain insights about sales effectiveness and call performance.
Some of the most common areas where conversational intelligence can be helpful are -
Evaluates signals to help you understand where the deal currently stands and how to go about it.
Receive actionable insights and cues on deals and accounts, and how to answer specific objections, qualifiable questions, and more.
Recognize best practices with reference to previous sales calls within each stage of the sales lifecycle to push a deal faster in the pipeline.
Track win rates, understand win vs loss rates against competitors, how your organization stands out from the crowd, and more.
Sales call analytics with the help of conversational intelligence accelerates the sales journey by uncovering vital insights into the performance of the deal, thus shortening the sales cycle.
Artificial intelligence has the capability to analyze historical data to make predictive forecasts about future sales results with the leverage of various AI predictive algorithms.
This can be used to identify new prospects, find the ideal customer fit, observe buying signals from prospects, and even aid social listening.
Conversational intelligence also provides the opportunity to upsell and cross-sell supporting products/features as recommendations to the customer to help with the sales engagement.
This type of automation can help validate a salesperson’s approach when fabricating a deal and deciding on the approach to move the deal based on the customer’s needs.

The digital sales landscape today is highly competitive. The best way to stand out in this environment is through impactful sales engagement. Sales teams should create a data-driven sales engagement strategy that simplifies prospect outreach and conversion.
The best way to develop a data-driven approach to sales is through the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this article, we’ll explain how you can master the art of sales engagement by leveraging AI.
Sales engagement refers to all those interactions between a sales rep and a prospect that take place throughout the sales cycle. In the current digital landscape, the majority of these interactions happen over calls, text messages, social media, and other digital modes. Businesses can easily make the most of these digital touchpoints to develop enticing sales engagement strategies and boost profit margins.
A data-centric strategy leaves less room for generic assumptions. Instead, it leverages AI and a large volume of customer datasets to identify how, when and whom to engage for quick conversion.
Before we move ahead, let’s distinguish between sales enablement and sales engagement. Both of these terms may sound similar but are completely different.
Sales engagement is efficiency-focused as it believes in creating stellar prospect engagement strategies to increase sales engagement. Sales enablement is effectiveness-focused. Its purpose is to ensure that your sales team can get involved in impactful engagement activities with proper knowledge of the team’s sales performance.
The best approach is to combine both sales engagement and sales enablement to scale your business.
AI is an ever-evolving field with several scopes of success. Recent developments in AI, including developments in big data and deep learning, have made remarkable changes to various outreach sales engagement activities. Let’s discuss the key steps to leverage AI in improving sales engagement:
You can use an AI-enabled conversational analytics software like SalesKen to perform lead scoring. A business can have several leads in its sales pipeline. However, a more thoughtful approach is to nurture the prospects with high purchase intent. In this overly competitive digital sales landscape, you can’t spend your valuable time with prospects who have a low purchase intent.
A conversational analytics software leverages AI to conduct lead scoring of your prospects. It analyses your reps’ conversations with the prospects to identify their intent, objections, and other expectations accurately. Hence, it becomes easier for your team to differentiate between the high-intent and low-intent leads and align your sales strategy accordingly.
How long does it take you to schedule a meeting after a prospect agrees to a quick demo? Prospect calls are major sales engagement activities and the best way to make the most of them is through automated prospect meetings. Various AI-based tools can amp up your sales engagement game by creating quick meetings.
These tools can analyse your calendar within seconds to identify the available free slots to set up a quick prospect meeting. In case of any unavoidable delays, this tool can recommend other available time slots as well. Reducing manual errors and automating the scheduling process will speed up your sales engagement activities.
The secret to successful sales engagement is personalisation. AI can help you access large datasets generated from different sources like cookies, browsing history, in-app data, etc. That way, it becomes easier for you to implement these insights into practice and create a personalized prospect engagement strategy.
This could be anything starting from personalised sales pitches, emails, content, product recommendations, social media targeting, ads, and so on. AI can help you create a personalized journey for each prospect through the proper utilisation of data.
Prospects and customers leave a long digital trail, no matter which platform they're on. AI can help you follow these trails to identify actionable consumer insights and make the best use of them to boost sales engagement activities. With AI, businesses can analyse customer feedback, interaction times, no. of sessions, service requests, etc., to understand their needs and preferences better.
AI is the key to tracking customers’ digital trails. AI-enabled tools can analyse the suitable customer datasets and transfer them to the correct department to ensure the appropriate use of data that can lead to informed decision-making. It’s time that you start investing more in such tools to get in-depth customer insights.
An AI-powered sales enablement tool focuses on effective knowledge transfer among the reps. Salesken which is the best can provide 1:1, personalized, real-time coaching to the reps by analysing their conversations with prospects, offering in-depth insights and identifying areas for improvement during an ongoing conversation.
The reps can make the most of these live suggestions to revise their sales engagement strategies and take a sales prospect to the funnel stage. It becomes easier to build trust and credibility with a sales enablement tool that guides your reps efficiently.
AI can remove all the guesswork and biases from your sales process. It can perform core data analysis to make the most accurate predictions on consumers’ future activities. That way, reps can easily position the target customers and their needs to plan appropriate sales engagement strategies.
It’s time to move on from the traditional sales engagement strategies that are largely based on siloed data, with huge room for assumptions, which leads to countless missed calls and zero conversions. On the contrary, AI ensures that businesses enjoy accurate sales forecasts and drive higher sales engagement accordingly.
Sales managers already have too much on their plates! Do they have the time and energy to conduct 1:1 discussions with each rep to boost their productivity? Probably not! It’s better that you leverage the power of AI to motivate the reps.
The AI/ML-enabled speech analytics tools like SalesKen can provide constructive feedback and suggestions to each rep regarding their sales process. Hence, they can figure out their improvement areas on their own, without any involvement from the sales manager. This can effectively boost their productivity and help them gain confidence.
One of the most effective sales engagement strategies is to bridge the gap between the sales and marketing teams. Ideally, marketing teams can help with the lead generation process and help nurture leads, while sales reps may focus on converting those leads.
AI can help you create a consolidated dashboard consisting of essential marketing metrics. Hence, your sales teams can have a 360-degree view of the marketing activities and gain better insights into lead generation activities. AI can help align your marketing and sales activities for higher sales engagement.
We hope that you have a clear picture of sales engagement and the role of AI in maximising its potential. As mentioned, AI-enabled conversational analytics software SalesKen can help improve engagement. Book a demo to learn more!

This could be anything starting from personalised sales pitches, emails, content, product recommendations, social media targeting, ads, and so on. AI can help you create a personalized journey for each prospect through the proper utilisation of data.
Prospects and customers leave a long digital trail, no matter which platform they're on. AI can help you follow these trails to identify actionable consumer insights and make the best use of them to boost sales engagement activities. With AI, businesses can analyse customer feedback, interaction times, no. of sessions, service requests, etc., to understand their needs and preferences better.
AI is the key to tracking customers’ digital trails. AI-enabled tools can analyse the suitable customer datasets and transfer them to the correct department to ensure the appropriate use of data that can lead to informed decision-making. It’s time that you start investing more in such tools to get in-depth customer insights.
An AI-powered sales enablement tool focuses on effective knowledge transfer among the reps. Salesken which is the best can provide 1:1, personalized, real-time coaching to the reps by analysing their conversations with prospects, offering in-depth insights and identifying areas for improvement during an ongoing conversation.
The reps can make the most of these live suggestions to revise their sales engagement strategies and take a sales prospect to the funnel stage. It becomes easier to build trust and credibility with a sales enablement tool that guides your reps efficiently.
AI can remove all the guesswork and biases from your sales process. It can perform core data analysis to make the most accurate predictions on consumers’ future activities. That way, reps can easily position the target customers and their needs to plan appropriate sales engagement strategies.
It’s time to move on from the traditional sales engagement strategies that are largely based on siloed data, with huge room for assumptions, which leads to countless missed calls and zero conversions. On the contrary, AI ensures that businesses enjoy accurate sales forecasts and drive higher sales engagement accordingly.
Sales managers already have too much on their plates! Do they have the time and energy to conduct 1:1 discussions with each rep to boost their productivity? Probably not! It’s better that you leverage the power of AI to motivate the reps.
The AI/ML-enabled speech analytics tools like SalesKen can provide constructive feedback and suggestions to each rep regarding their sales process. Hence, they can figure out their improvement areas on their own, without any involvement from the sales manager. This can effectively boost their productivity and help them gain confidence.
One of the most effective sales engagement strategies is to bridge the gap between the sales and marketing teams. Ideally, marketing teams can help with the lead generation process and help nurture leads, while sales reps may focus on converting those leads.
AI can help you create a consolidated dashboard consisting of essential marketing metrics. Hence, your sales teams can have a 360-degree view of the marketing activities and gain better insights into lead generation activities. AI can help align your marketing and sales activities for higher sales engagement.
We hope that you have a clear picture of sales engagement and the role of AI in maximising its potential. As mentioned, AI-enabled conversational analytics software SalesKen can help improve engagement. Book a demo to learn more!

The world is evolving every day, and so are our ways of interaction. We live in a age where business deals happen over social media chat boxes. Some people are still using traditional methods like cold calling in a world ruled by digital marketing. Cold calling involves selling to prospects through unsolicited phone calls.
But does cold calling work?
Cold calling can be a daunting process because they are not always received well by people. Cold callers have a reputation for being annoying and intrusive. Most of them find their way to people's block list. So why isn’t cold calling dead already?
The statistics below paint an interesting picture:
All these statistics confirm that cold calling is very much alive, and how! Many businesses or salespeople back out from cold calling for fear of being rejected or mistreated. This is probably because you don’t know the right way to approach prospects.
Well, don’t worry because we will show you how you can ace your cold calling game with the help of six tried and tested steps.
Let’s dive in!
Here are some tips that will come in handy for sales teams to ace their cold calling game:
One of the greatest mistakes you can make while cold calling is not caring enough to know about your prospect. Some salespeople call random people whose numbers they find on local directories. If you start calling random people, there’s a high chance that you’ll be rejected, leaving you discouraged.
Always make an effort to learn relevant information about your prospect before calling. So that while you are on the call, you can bring it up to get their attention in a personalized way.
For example, if you offer a recruiting service, you may say, “Hey Miss/Mr X, we have been following your posts for a while and noticed that you are looking for a communication coordinator in your office…”
Personalizing your calls will make your prospect feel valued and important. It will give the impression that you are invested in offering a solution to them through your service or products and not just calling them to feed your sales figure.
Pressing that record button and recording your call will help you analyze your conversation technique and improve your performance. This is especially true during the initial days of cold calling, as you might make certain mistakes. Listening to your call records will help you self reflect.
You can figure out where you went right or wrong. For instance, when the customer lost interest or what topic triggered their interest and so on. It is a great way to improve your skills and strategise your next steps. Your cold calling success rates can significantly increase if you strategise your conversation and plan your moves well.
A tool that can help you here is Salesken. This speech analytics tool can analyze all the recorded conversations between reps and prospects and identify the key areas for improvement. An intent-based lead scoring process can help you distinguish between valuable and non-valuable leads. Therefore, it becomes easier to identify the right leads and engage with them over cold calling. The chances of conversion are higher.

Now that you have analysed all your call records, you have a fair idea about how people react, what questions they ask, and what triggers their interest. Call success will depend on how well you present your motive and answer the prospect’s questions with precision.
The next best thing you can do is gather and list all the important analyses from your call records, and prepare a script. Practice your script so you sound natural and engaging and not robotic.
Most people are probably busy and are less likely to pick up the call or engage in any form of conversation if you call them at the wrong time. Do your research and figure out a suitable calling time that works for both of you.
You can research their working hours, holidays and break time. Prospects will probably not talk with you during office hours but can spare a few seconds during their breaks. An Inside sales study found that Wednesdays and Thursdays are the best days where prospects are likely to engage with your call.
The first few seconds are crucial in a cold calling. It determines whether the prospect will hang up or continue talking to you. And it all depends on the way you introduce the motive of the call. Don’t beat around the bush, don’t pitch in too early. Be personal, be polite and be direct. Address the prospect on a first name basis adding a suitable title. For example, “Good evening Mr X or Miss Y,” where ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are their first name.
People will directly disconnect your call if your reason for calling doesn’t seem compelling enough. Be enthusiastic with your greeting and introduce the subject of your call to trigger their interest. The call's success will depend on your ability to attract your prospect in the initial seconds of the call.
One of the greatest mistakes you can make while cold calling is pitching too early or too late. Pitching too early can come off as desperate and self-centred, and late pitching can risk not getting to the point and boring your potential customers.
To figure out the most suitable pitching time, begin by introducing the motive of the call. Then, bring up the prospect’s problems or needs and introduce your pitch in the form of a solution that you are offering. There is no point in dragging the conversation longer. Your prospects have spared a few seconds of their valuable time to listen to you, try to make it worthwhile and short.
To close a deal successfully, every cold caller has to get past certain roadblocks. We will be discussing the three important factors that can come in the way of your call's success and how to address them.
When you try calling a senior executive, you may have to get past their assistants or receptionists. Their role is to ensure that only valid and important calls are forwarded to the executives to avoid wasting any time. Be confident, direct and concise while interacting with them. Present an image of someone important with a legitimate reason to connect. The assistant will be bound to divert the call to the executive.
Follow up calls are crucial. Many times prospects ask you to call on a different date. In the interim, the potential customer may lose interest in your offering or completely forget about your existence.
The follow-up call is as important as the first call. You may have to get past the assistants again. Hark back to the previous time you spoke, refresh their memory a little and continue to talk with confidence.
Never seem desperate or pushy while trying to close the deal. This can make your prospect uncomfortable. Keep them intrigued and position the deal in a way that seems attractive to them. If the prospects seem hesitant, offer them incentives in the form of discounts or promotional codes. This can take you towards the final point of closing the deal successfully.
Cold calling is still a relevant method for closing important deals. While rejections and disappointments are par for the course and you will not get a successful deal in every cold calling process, it’s still an effective method. It is just a matter of strategy and planning. Once you learn how to cold call properly, there is no one to stop you and your business from reaching new heights!

Cold calling is an attempt to call a stranger, unsolicited, for the first time. In sales, you should ideally make a cold call after in-depth research about a prospect so that the possibilities of conversion are higher.
Cold calling is a good way to generate leads. However, cold calling should be done ethically.

The age-old tactic of selling by trying to build false rapport is obsolete now. Such sales talk will not get you far. If responses such as “No, thanks, I’m not interested” or “Just send an email instead” are familiar to you, then it’s time to improve your current sales talk track.
Effective selling requires powerful language. To build that value from the ground up, fix your sales talk track. The better your talk track is, the better your script will be, and ultimately, the better your sales conversation will be.
A sales talk track is defined as “a checklist planned to assist you during a call with your prospect.” A talk track consists of shortlists of information or ideas that sales reps use while talking to a prospect to cover important points related to your product.
The purpose of a talk track is to ensure that by the end of the call you have critical information about your prospect to set an agenda and move the discussion forward.
Without a proper talk track in place, it is almost impossible to move ahead.
If you want to increase your revenue from your sales team, but if you’re not considering having an actionable sales talk track in place you will miss more than hit the quota quarter on quarter.
Keep the following in mind when using a talk track in your sales conversations:
Here’s how to structure your talk track for your sales conversations:
A sales talk track consists of four components: opener, qualifying, presentation and closing. Each of these components consists of mini-steps.
Start by thanking the customer for meeting with you. Do not jump right into the agenda and talk about your product right away.
Give your customer an opportunity to speak about themselves. For instance, ask the client about their role in their organization and what their day-to-day looks like.
Then, transition the conversation seamlessly into the qualifying component.
Frame the sales conversation around the buyer and their challenges. The qualifying component of the talk track focuses on the buyer’s goals, challenges, and responsibilities.
Here are a few suggestions to research before the call:
Prepare a set of questions based on your research that might support your pitch to understand the buyer and their problems better.
Leverage the insights gained from your call with the buyer to understand their needs to position your offering. The purpose of this is to get the customers’ acceptance to aid your selling process.
Once you understand the buyer and their needs, demonstrate your product with a sales demo and a corresponding sales pitch deck to support your statements. A positive outcome from the demo will put you in a much stronger position than when you initially started the conversation.
Once you seek the right information about your stakeholders, end the conversation with the critical information you need to qualify to move the sales process ahead.
But, how can your sales team improve their current talk track in their sales conversations?
A pitch’s purpose is to always pique the curiosity of the client. Ensure that your pitch is attention-grabbing and show the bigger picture to your clients. Pick just one crucial benefit that is truly your product’s USP, and make sure you weave a narrative around it. Do not cover too much and overwhelm or confuse the buyer with your pitch.
Make sure that your talk track is always about your prospect.
While asking questions is important, avoid finishing your pitch with questions that invoke doubt like “Does this make sense to you?” or “Would you like to try our other product?” - these questions will make the client feel less valued.
Instead, close the conversation with positive and confident testaments of clients benefiting from using your product. And THEN follow up with questions. This makes them feel confident about your authority around the product and close the call with a commitment to move further in the process.
Any good sales rep will listen more than they talk.
Any sales conversation should be a two-way street and focus more on learning and understanding your buyer. This happens through active listening.
Listen to your prospect actively and ask relevant questions. Typically, your buyers are experts in their fields and getting them to talk more will not only help you understand them better but also build rapport.
Depending heavily on manual work for all sales processes will most likely lead to human errors and make it difficult to keep up with your buyers.
Leveraging smart tech software like Salesken to enhance a talk track will get you several stages ahead. Salesken will help you set an agenda, keep track of your prospects’ conversations with real-time cues, learn how effective is your pipeline with call tracking metrics, and more.
With a conversational sales intelligence platform like Salesken, you can make calls, get cues to navigate the conversation, track the conversation, and come up with a strategy to push the sales agenda further into the funnel.
Asking your buyers unexpected questions will get their attention and keep them engaged throughout your sales conversation. Asking unique questions that show interest and aren’t opportunistic will definitely encourage prospects to talk and share more and help you build rapport.
For instance, if your prospect is from the hospitality sector, in addition to asking questions about their industry, organization, and processes, you could ask a question like, “With COVID-19 in picture, how are you trying to navigate the situation and instill more safety in your establishment?”
With prior research and asking open-ended questions to your buyer, personalisation should be a natural flow of your sales talk track.
While a talk track will act as a guide to assist you throughout your conversation, always leave some room for personalisation in the call. Look up your prospect on LinkedIn, Twitter, or any other public platform to gather insights about them, their interests, and their work to build deeper connections.
In addition, leveraging speech analytics software like Salesken will help you keep up with your conversation with real-time cues.
One of the biggest mistakes that sales reps make is using generic and confusing sales jargon.
Using technical terms such as CPM, retention, product analytics, farming, and so on only confuses the buyer further. Even if your clients understand such jargon, it is best to avoid bringing up lingo that does not add value to your conversation.
The best way to lead sales conversations is by using easy-to-understand terms and concepts to explain your product and make that pitch.
Setting up an agenda and focusing on your north star benefits your sales conversation, while organizing your ideas into separate categories makes it easier to articulate them.
Categorize your calls into different sections that add weightage to your pitch and help you build a personal connection with your prospect. The sections could include an opener, understanding the purpose of the call, a product demo, success stories, and a call to action.
The more organized you are, the better you will be able to pitch and close your conversation.
Sales conversational intelligence and analytics tools such as Salesken will help you automate manual tasks and provide real-time data and analytics to always be on track with your sales conversations.

A sales talk track is an outline for sales representatives to follow during a sales process with prospective customers. Talk tracks provide structure to sales conversations so sales reps can focus on creating value, winning deals, and moving ahead in the conversation.
The goal of any sales presentation is to persuade the prospects to buy your product or service. A good sales talk is one that comprises a verbal speech, illustrative props, audio or video to support your pitch with positive examples, and a concentrated look at the product you are selling.

The age-old tactic of selling by trying to build false rapport is obsolete now. Such sales talk will not get you far. If responses such as “No, thanks, I’m not interested” or “Just send an email instead” are familiar to you, then it’s time to improve your current sales talk track.
Effective selling requires powerful language. To build that value from the ground up, fix your sales talk track. The better your talk track is, the better your script will be, and ultimately, the better your sales conversation will be.
A sales talk track is defined as “a checklist planned to assist you during a call with your prospect.” A talk track consists of shortlists of information or ideas that sales reps use while talking to a prospect to cover important points related to your product.
The purpose of a talk track is to ensure that by the end of the call you have critical information about your prospect to set an agenda and move the discussion forward.
Without a proper talk track in place, it is almost impossible to move ahead.
If you want to increase your revenue from your sales team, but if you’re not considering having an actionable sales talk track in place you will miss more than hit the quota quarter on quarter.
Keep the following in mind when using a talk track in your sales conversations:
Here’s how to structure your talk track for your sales conversations:
A sales talk track consists of four components: opener, qualifying, presentation and closing. Each of these components consists of mini-steps.
Start by thanking the customer for meeting with you. Do not jump right into the agenda and talk about your product right away.
Give your customer an opportunity to speak about themselves. For instance, ask the client about their role in their organization and what their day-to-day looks like.
Then, transition the conversation seamlessly into the qualifying component.
Frame the sales conversation around the buyer and their challenges. The qualifying component of the talk track focuses on the buyer’s goals, challenges, and responsibilities.
Here are a few suggestions to research before the call:
Prepare a set of questions based on your research that might support your pitch to understand the buyer and their problems better.
Leverage the insights gained from your call with the buyer to understand their needs to position your offering. The purpose of this is to get the customers’ acceptance to aid your selling process.
Once you understand the buyer and their needs, demonstrate your product with a sales demo and a corresponding sales pitch deck to support your statements. A positive outcome from the demo will put you in a much stronger position than when you initially started the conversation.
Once you seek the right information about your stakeholders, end the conversation with the critical information you need to qualify to move the sales process ahead.
But, how can your sales team improve their current talk track in their sales conversations?
A pitch’s purpose is to always pique the curiosity of the client. Ensure that your pitch is attention-grabbing and show the bigger picture to your clients. Pick just one crucial benefit that is truly your product’s USP, and make sure you weave a narrative around it. Do not cover too much and overwhelm or confuse the buyer with your pitch.
Make sure that your talk track is always about your prospect.
While asking questions is important, avoid finishing your pitch with questions that invoke doubt like “Does this make sense to you?” or “Would you like to try our other product?” - these questions will make the client feel less valued.
Instead, close the conversation with positive and confident testaments of clients benefiting from using your product. And THEN follow up with questions. This makes them feel confident about your authority around the product and close the call with a commitment to move further in the process.
Any good sales rep will listen more than they talk.
Any sales conversation should be a two-way street and focus more on learning and understanding your buyer. This happens through active listening.
Listen to your prospect actively and ask relevant questions. Typically, your buyers are experts in their fields and getting them to talk more will not only help you understand them better but also build rapport.
Depending heavily on manual work for all sales processes will most likely lead to human errors and make it difficult to keep up with your buyers.
Leveraging smart tech software like Salesken to enhance a talk track will get you several stages ahead. Salesken will help you set an agenda, keep track of your prospects’ conversations with real-time cues, learn how effective is your pipeline with call tracking metrics, and more.
With a conversational sales intelligence platform like Salesken, you can make calls, get cues to navigate the conversation, track the conversation, and come up with a strategy to push the sales agenda further into the funnel.
Asking your buyers unexpected questions will get their attention and keep them engaged throughout your sales conversation. Asking unique questions that show interest and aren’t opportunistic will definitely encourage prospects to talk and share more and help you build rapport.
For instance, if your prospect is from the hospitality sector, in addition to asking questions about their industry, organization, and processes, you could ask a question like, “With COVID-19 in picture, how are you trying to navigate the situation and instill more safety in your establishment?”
With prior research and asking open-ended questions to your buyer, personalisation should be a natural flow of your sales talk track.
While a talk track will act as a guide to assist you throughout your conversation, always leave some room for personalisation in the call. Look up your prospect on LinkedIn, Twitter, or any other public platform to gather insights about them, their interests, and their work to build deeper connections.
In addition, leveraging speech analytics software like Salesken will help you keep up with your conversation with real-time cues.
One of the biggest mistakes that sales reps make is using generic and confusing sales jargon.
Using technical terms such as CPM, retention, product analytics, farming, and so on only confuses the buyer further. Even if your clients understand such jargon, it is best to avoid bringing up lingo that does not add value to your conversation.
The best way to lead sales conversations is by using easy-to-understand terms and concepts to explain your product and make that pitch.
Setting up an agenda and focusing on your north star benefits your sales conversation, while organizing your ideas into separate categories makes it easier to articulate them.
Categorize your calls into different sections that add weightage to your pitch and help you build a personal connection with your prospect. The sections could include an opener, understanding the purpose of the call, a product demo, success stories, and a call to action.

Cold calling isn’t dead. Several companies, from Fortune 500s to startups, still rely on cold calling to bring in fresh leads and drive revenue.
The question you might have had is, does cold calling still work in 2022?
‍The answer is YES. However, there is a caveat. If you’re still cold calling like it’s 2003, especially with B2B cold calling, you might as well skip doing it.
With 82% of buyers willing to speak to the salesperson who reaches out to them, cold calling is here to stay and will continue to thrive.
In this article, we’ve put together 20 B2B cold calling best practices for anyone who wants to close more sales and find prospects faster.
B2B cold calling is a type of sales call in which a sales representative of one business calls a prospect of another business with the intention to sell a product or service.
B2B cold calling can either be outsourced to a call center or done by in-house sales experts. It can involve inbound calls, outbound calls, or a combination of both.
B2B sales cold calling helps generate leads and is a good practice for improving business. It can also be highly beneficial for B2B businesses where one sales rep doesn’t know another from a potential client’s organization. B2B cold calling is often an alternative method to marketing when there are too many companies to target or when too many companies are competing for the same set of leads.
Although B2B cold calling can be time-consuming, it is also proven to be highly successful for businesses as it helps your organization to identify the right target, increase conversions, gain deeper insights into the market, and even establish relationships with the buyer.
Regardless of your company’s domain, cold calling acts as a primary tool to build your list of prospects and help you land more deals. According to studies, organizations who believed that cold calling is no longer effective experienced 42% less growth than those who believed otherwise.
B2B cold calling still works wonders. To help you nail your next B2B outbound call, we’ve put together 20 B2B cold calling best practices to close more deals but quicker.
Leverage tools such as LinkedIn and email marketing to better understand the person and the brand’s identity and map out any issues your solution can help solve.
Timing is everything.
76% of sales representatives agree that having the right skill to engage the prospect at the right time will have a significant impact on the chance of a conversion.
This holds especially true for B2B calls since most executives are occupied during certain times of the day.
Write a pre-defined, actionable sales script to sound confident, stay focused on the agenda, and make your point quickly and clearly.
Typically, sales representatives try to recreate their best cold calling scripts for their cold calls. Although this is a good practice, the success of recreating such calls, however, does not completely depend on the script alone but also on how well you use it.
Personalize your cold calling script for each prospect and add a human touch to the call to connect deeper with the client and, in turn, help the prospect be more responsive throughout the call.
Spontaneity can sometimes yield wonderful outcomes. However, for consistent results, practice is the way to go.
Cold calling mistakes can result in bad sales. While even seasoned salespersons may stumble sometimes, preparation can help everyone avoid roadblocks and obvious embarrassing mistakes.
This is an area where technology can be a great help. Salesken’s sales performance management software can help you analyse your performance during a call by going back to your previously recorded call to listen to them and learn from their mistakes. You can then iterate and improve performance, create multiple approaches and test out the most effective methods to close any sale.
It’s never easy to know your prospect’s emotions when you make that B2B cold call. Customers are humans, and you aren’t a mind reader either.
Not everyone will be in the right mood to hear you sell your product to them, so it is absolutely vital and human to analyse this during the call to not overstep.
By leveraging the right technology tools, like Salesken, you can analyze your potential customer’s emotions (be it excited or bored, happy or upset) and pitch your product accordingly.
An important benchmark for cold calling is the 30-30-50 rule for cold emailing and the 30-50-50 rule for cold calling.
Keep these benchmarks as your starting point for any B2B outreach. Knowing where you stand with these metrics can give you an insight into how successful your cold calls are.
Cold calling for multiple hours on a daily basis can get very daunting. Dialing potential leads and hearing the same rejection over and again can be very demoralizing.
It can be tempting to multitask and distract yourself during a cold call, but multitasking while being on a B2B cold call can potentially make you lose out on the sale as your attention is not fully on your client. You will miss out on important questions, lose track of your pitch, and even be flustered. It’ll also take you longer to close, leading to more boredom and distraction. So, instead of multitasking, schedule clear breaks to unwind. But when you’re on call, pay attention, and focus wholly on the call to make the sale quicker.
Instead of closed questions that elicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers, asking relevant open-ended questions can help you collect valuable information about a potential client’s organization and better understand their process.
Questions about their current business scenario, future roadmap, and how they are trying to incorporate your product into their business can help you establish a genuine connection with the client.
Asking open-ended questions can also help the client understand that you are genuinely trying to solve their problem and not looking for a sale, thus making the call more engaging.
If your buyers do not see the value in the product you are trying to sell, irrespective of the pricing range, you will not be successful in making the sale.
So, always start the call with a strong opener about your product and help them comprehend the benefits. Once you lay down the value of your product, introduce the pricing. Always be open to negotiating the price and never stick to a final price card.
This approach also helps build a relationship with the client that’ll last beyond just one sale.
Rejection is par for the course in sales. Although retaining your current customers is important, rejections shouldn’t stop you from going after new ones.
Know that every cold call won’t magically turn into a successful sale. Rather than personalizing the rejection and taking it to heart, pay attention to the reason behind it, and use that to learn and improve. Brainstorm ideas with your team and find solutions.
Great cold calling goes in hand-in-hand with great supporting software to aid you with your everyday tasks.
On average, a sales rep makes about 52 calls in a day, with 15% of their time spent leaving voicemails. Working smart and leveraging the right technology is one of the most important skills to have.
Sales technology tools such as Salesken can help you minimize and automate your most daunting tasks as a sales rep. With Salesken, you can make calls via the tool, analyze the call performance on your dashboard, share it with your managers, receive real-time cues to handle the calls, and even link your CRM to scale the effort further.
Switching to smart technology for cold calling can help you surpass your competitors to stay ahead of ever-changing trends in a hassle-free, streamlined way.
In B2B, potential buyers always appreciate a prior email introducing yourself and your product to them. Warming up your client before you make that call will help them learn the agenda behind your call. A first cold call might help in some cases, but in some, they don’t.
So, send an introductory email, track its delivery, and set the objective of the connection right. Make the call once the email has been opened by your client, and ensure you send an email after the call too.
This way, your B2B customer journey and funnel become seamless and you can close the deal faster.
Despite the fact that your main objective behind the cold is to make a sale, always be human first and try to empathize with your potential client.
There is no second chance in cold calling– the first impression is everything. If you come across as rude, low energy or not adding value, you will never get a second chance again with the company.
Your opening statement and your tone throughout the call must be friendly and also capture their attention. Use words like “we” and “us” instead of “I” and “me”, and try to relate with the customer.
This simple approach can increase your chances of arranging a second meeting with your potential client.
Salespeople only have about 5-10 minutes to convince the prospects via cold calling. With the listener’s attention span limited, do not try to squeeze in too much information in one call.
When pitching your product on the call, stick to only the most important points– information you absolutely cannot miss. This approach ensures the customer isn’t lost in a sea of overwhelming information and can actually remember what you spoke about. You may also repeat the same points to help them remember.
Save the more elaborate conversations for the demo calls and stick to quick wins instead.
Following a sales script is ideal, but using the same sales script for every kind of call will not result in a successful callback. By researching your prospect beforehand, jot down points that will help you connect with them and pitch your product in a way that helps them connect dots with your solution and their unique issues. This helps you make a connection with the buyer and also retain their attention.
Break the ice with a strong opener. Connect with the prospect by being human and relatable.
Build a rapport by sharing a customer success story (ideally one resolving the same issue as theirs) to build credibility. Pick 2-3 business problems that your product has solved for a client from the same industry and strike a meaningful conversation by highlighting the route taken to solve their problem.
Be a great storyteller and help them visualize the journey they will be a part of if they onboard you.
A great salesperson will listen more than they speak.
Listening carefully can help you understand the prospect’s problem and suggest an appropriate solution.
Talking continuously without letting the other person get a word in, talking at them rather than to them, and interrupting the prospect can annoy them and ambush your sales process.
As a rule of thumb, listen well, and then speak to never make your prospect feel valued.
93% of the potential success of your B2B cold call is attributed to the tone of your voice during the conversation. You might be great at pitching your product in a technical way, but if your tone isn’t right, then the entire purpose of the call falls apart.
Don’t be too soft or too loud, as you may come across as aggressive. Aim for just an average tone to sound friendly. Don’t rush through your words; speak at a medium pace so your prospects understand what you are saying.
Be especially mindful of your tone when things don’t go your way. Handle objections and rejections with grace.
On average, a salesperson leaves behind 70 voicemails per day, taking up to 60 seconds each, which approximately adds up to 25 hours per year.
A typical voicemail does not add any value to the listener; the sales rep just rambles with a ton of filler words and wastes the client’s time with no callback number to get back to.
If you’re leaving voicemails, ensure that they spark interest– prepare a clear script and speak with confidence so the prospect is inclined to call you back immediately.
With an increasing amount of sales volume up your alley to target, sometimes it can get daunting to follow up on your prospect.

Cold calling isn’t dead. Several companies, from Fortune 500s to startups, still rely on cold calling to bring in fresh leads and drive revenue.
The question you might have had is, does cold calling still work in 2022?
‍The answer is YES. However, there is a caveat. If you’re still cold calling like it’s 2003, especially with B2B cold calling, you might as well skip doing it.
With 82% of buyers willing to speak to the salesperson who reaches out to them, cold calling is here to stay and will continue to thrive.
In this article, we’ve put together 20 B2B cold calling best practices for anyone who wants to close more sales and find prospects faster.
B2B cold calling is a type of sales call in which a sales representative of one business calls a prospect of another business with the intention to sell a product or service.
B2B cold calling can either be outsourced to a call center or done by in-house sales experts. It can involve inbound calls, outbound calls, or a combination of both.
B2B sales cold calling helps generate leads and is a good practice for improving business. It can also be highly beneficial for B2B businesses where one sales rep doesn’t know another from a potential client’s organization. B2B cold calling is often an alternative method to marketing when there are too many companies to target or when too many companies are competing for the same set of leads.
Although B2B cold calling can be time-consuming, it is also proven to be highly successful for businesses as it helps your organization to identify the right target, increase conversions, gain deeper insights into the market, and even establish relationships with the buyer.
Regardless of your company’s domain, cold calling acts as a primary tool to build your list of prospects and help you land more deals. According to studies, organizations who believed that cold calling is no longer effective experienced 42% less growth than those who believed otherwise.
B2B cold calling still works wonders. To help you nail your next B2B outbound call, we’ve put together 20 B2B cold calling best practices to close more deals but quicker.
Leverage tools such as LinkedIn and email marketing to better understand the person and the brand’s identity and map out any issues your solution can help solve.
Timing is everything.
76% of sales representatives agree that having the right skill to engage the prospect at the right time will have a significant impact on the chance of a conversion.
This holds especially true for B2B calls since most executives are occupied during certain times of the day.
Write a pre-defined, actionable sales script to sound confident, stay focused on the agenda, and make your point quickly and clearly.
Typically, sales representatives try to recreate their best cold calling scripts for their cold calls. Although this is a good practice, the success of recreating such calls, however, does not completely depend on the script alone but also on how well you use it.
Personalize your cold calling script for each prospect and add a human touch to the call to connect deeper with the client and, in turn, help the prospect be more responsive throughout the call.
Spontaneity can sometimes yield wonderful outcomes. However, for consistent results, practice is the way to go.
Cold calling mistakes can result in bad sales. While even seasoned salespersons may stumble sometimes, preparation can help everyone avoid roadblocks and obvious embarrassing mistakes.
This is an area where technology can be a great help. Salesken’s sales performance management software can help you analyse your performance during a call by going back to your previously recorded call to listen to them and learn from their mistakes. You can then iterate and improve performance, create multiple approaches and test out the most effective methods to close any sale.
It’s never easy to know your prospect’s emotions when you make that B2B cold call. Customers are humans, and you aren’t a mind reader either.
Not everyone will be in the right mood to hear you sell your product to them, so it is absolutely vital and human to analyse this during the call to not overstep.
By leveraging the right technology tools, like Salesken, you can analyze your potential customer’s emotions (be it excited or bored, happy or upset) and pitch your product accordingly.
An important benchmark for cold calling is the 30-30-50 rule for cold emailing and the 30-50-50 rule for cold calling.
Keep these benchmarks as your starting point for any B2B outreach. Knowing where you stand with these metrics can give you an insight into how successful your cold calls are.
Cold calling for multiple hours on a daily basis can get very daunting. Dialing potential leads and hearing the same rejection over and again can be very demoralizing.
It can be tempting to multitask and distract yourself during a cold call, but multitasking while being on a B2B cold call can potentially make you lose out on the sale as your attention is not fully on your client. You will miss out on important questions, lose track of your pitch, and even be flustered. It’ll also take you longer to close, leading to more boredom and distraction. So, instead of multitasking, schedule clear breaks to unwind. But when you’re on call, pay attention, and focus wholly on the call to make the sale quicker.
Instead of closed questions that elicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers, asking relevant open-ended questions can help you collect valuable information about a potential client’s organization and better understand their process.
Questions about their current business scenario, future roadmap, and how they are trying to incorporate your product into their business can help you establish a genuine connection with the client.
Asking open-ended questions can also help the client understand that you are genuinely trying to solve their problem and not looking for a sale, thus making the call more engaging.
If your buyers do not see the value in the product you are trying to sell, irrespective of the pricing range, you will not be successful in making the sale.
So, always start the call with a strong opener about your product and help them comprehend the benefits. Once you lay down the value of your product, introduce the pricing. Always be open to negotiating the price and never stick to a final price card.
This approach also helps build a relationship with the client that’ll last beyond just one sale.
Rejection is par for the course in sales. Although retaining your current customers is important, rejections shouldn’t stop you from going after new ones.
Know that every cold call won’t magically turn into a successful sale. Rather than personalizing the rejection and taking it to heart, pay attention to the reason behind it, and use that to learn and improve. Brainstorm ideas with your team and find solutions.
Great cold calling goes in hand-in-hand with great supporting software to aid you with your everyday tasks.
On average, a sales rep makes about 52 calls in a day, with 15% of their time spent leaving voicemails. Working smart and leveraging the right technology is one of the most important skills to have.
Sales technology tools such as Salesken can help you minimize and automate your most daunting tasks as a sales rep. With Salesken, you can make calls via the tool, analyze the call performance on your dashboard, share it with your managers, receive real-time cues to handle the calls, and even link your CRM to scale the effort further.
Switching to smart technology for cold calling can help you surpass your competitors to stay ahead of ever-changing trends in a hassle-free, streamlined way.
In B2B, potential buyers always appreciate a prior email introducing yourself and your product to them. Warming up your client before you make that call will help them learn the agenda behind your call. A first cold call might help in some cases, but in some, they don’t.
So, send an introductory email, track its delivery, and set the objective of the connection right. Make the call once the email has been opened by your client, and ensure you send an email after the call too.
This way, your B2B customer journey and funnel become seamless and you can close the deal faster.
Despite the fact that your main objective behind the cold is to make a sale, always be human first and try to empathize with your potential client.
There is no second chance in cold calling– the first impression is everything. If you come across as rude, low energy or not adding value, you will never get a second chance again with the company.
Your opening statement and your tone throughout the call must be friendly and also capture their attention. Use words like “we” and “us” instead of “I” and “me”, and try to relate with the customer.
This simple approach can increase your chances of arranging a second meeting with your potential client.
Salespeople only have about 5-10 minutes to convince the prospects via cold calling. With the listener’s attention span limited, do not try to squeeze in too much information in one call.
When pitching your product on the call, stick to only the most important points– information you absolutely cannot miss. This approach ensures the customer isn’t lost in a sea of overwhelming information and can actually remember what you spoke about. You may also repeat the same points to help them remember.
Save the more elaborate conversations for the demo calls and stick to quick wins instead.
Following a sales script is ideal, but using the same sales script for every kind of call will not result in a successful callback. By researching your prospect beforehand, jot down points that will help you connect with them and pitch your product in a way that helps them connect dots with your solution and their unique issues. This helps you make a connection with the buyer and also retain their attention.
Break the ice with a strong opener. Connect with the prospect by being human and relatable.
Build a rapport by sharing a customer success story (ideally one resolving the same issue as theirs) to build credibility. Pick 2-3 business problems that your product has solved for a client from the same industry and strike a meaningful conversation by highlighting the route taken to solve their problem.
Be a great storyteller and help them visualize the journey they will be a part of if they onboard you.
A great salesperson will listen more than they speak.
Listening carefully can help you understand the prospect’s problem and suggest an appropriate solution.
Talking continuously without letting the other person get a word in, talking at them rather than to them, and interrupting the prospect can annoy them and ambush your sales process.
As a rule of thumb, listen well, and then speak to never make your prospect feel valued.
93% of the potential success of your B2B cold call is attributed to the tone of your voice during the conversation. You might be great at pitching your product in a technical way, but if your tone isn’t right, then the entire purpose of the call falls apart.
Don’t be too soft or too loud, as you may come across as aggressive. Aim for just an average tone to sound friendly. Don’t rush through your words; speak at a medium pace so your prospects understand what you are saying.
Be especially mindful of your tone when things don’t go your way. Handle objections and rejections with grace.
On average, a salesperson leaves behind 70 voicemails per day, taking up to 60 seconds each, which approximately adds up to 25 hours per year.
A typical voicemail does not add any value to the listener; the sales rep just rambles with a ton of filler words and wastes the client’s time with no callback number to get back to.
If you’re leaving voicemails, ensure that they spark interest– prepare a clear script and speak with confidence so the prospect is inclined to call you back immediately.
With an increasing amount of sales volume up your alley to target, sometimes it can get daunting to follow up on your prospect.
But after all the hard work and following these B2B cold calling tips, don’t forget to follow up on your prospects to check their decision and the stage they are at. Make use of an intelligent technology tool like Salesken that reminds you to make that follow-up call and makes it easy to do so.
Following up with your prospect will help you understand if the buyer is genuinely interested in your product or not, helping them move further in your sales funnel or letting you focus on other prospects.
Never miss an opportunity again and be a champion of B2B cold calling.
An intuitive sales enablement tool like Salesken can help you increase conversions by improving overall productivity, identifying and fixing loopholes to act upon later, receiving real-time cues to understand how to improve your cold call conversation, closing more deals, and even building personalised strategies with the help of analytics.
Yes, absolutely. A B2B call is allowed as long as the call is placed from one business to another with the intent of selling their product by following the right code of conduct and language.
No, B2B cold calling is very much alive and thriving. Cold calling is believed to be one of the primary methods of procuring leads and increasing conversions in business.

Assume that you have developed a new product and it’s ready to launch in the market. You probably also have a sales and marketing strategy in place to distribute and promote the product. You’ve also planned to track certain KPIs to track the business performance.
But is that it? Will that give you the entire picture of how your product is performing in the market?
Not really! That’s precisely why you should understand and apply the concept of sales volume. Sales volume determines the number of units of a product you sell in a particular time period. Now the question is, how to increase sales volume?
This article will explain the concept of sales volume in detail along with the tried and tested strategies to increase it.
So, let’s begin! ‍
The concept of sales volume doesn’t focus on the financial gains from a product. Instead, it determines how many units of a product you sold. While estimating financial gain is essential, an insight into sales volume can help you identify business health to a large extent.
Marketers are often confused about their existing selling strategies and are clueless about how they should make adjustments to them. The sales volume metric helps their deep insights in that range and helps in making informed decisions.
So, now the question is how to find sales volume? Is there any particular formula?
Yes, there is.
Sales Volume = [ No. of items you sell per month * Necessary period ]
So, if you sell five books in a month on average and you’re trying to find the sales volume for a year, your sales volume will be = 5 * 12 = 60 books a year.
Here are a few strategies that you can apply to improve your current sales volume:
Increasing sales volume means selling larger units of a product. So, make sure that you know your products inside out.
These include having an in-depth idea of the key features, so you know what to emphasize. Knowing your product’s Unique Selling Point (USP) can help you stand out in the crowd.
Here’re some questions to consider for understanding the product better:
Once you find the answers to these questions, it will be easier to sell the products. ‍
Do you know your target customers? Do you have any idea what their expectations are from your products? What specific problem do they hope it will solve for them? Remember that 36% of customers are looking for personalization from their purchase experience.
So, it’s better that you research your prospect, discover their demands, and then approach them. Without a personalized sales approach, customers will hardly consider buying from you. Therefore, don’t forget to conduct in-depth research as it is one of the best ways to increase sales volume.
If you’re ready to increase your sales volume, start with assigning your top-performing reps to high-value prospects-- those whose purchase intent matches your product most closely and so are most likely to convert into paying customers.
Evidently, there’s a lot at stake when it comes to these high-value prospects, and you cannot risk losing them. So, it’s always a smart idea to assign experienced and top-performing reps to those prospects. They’ll know how to qualify such leads quickly.
However, the question is, how do you find out who your top-performing reps are? You can use sales analytics software like Salesken for that purpose. It can help you analyze the sales conversations of your reps to find out how efficiently they are nurturing and converting leads.
This could mean easier identification of your best-performing reps and employing them to handle high-value prospects.
Do you know of the concept of pain-based selling? Let’s simplify it for you. In the pain-based selling process, a brand interacts with prospects to identify their pain points.
Next, they try to convert these pain points into benefits for the prospects. It is one of the best ways to increase sales and business volume.
Here are some questions that you can ask your prospects to develop a comprehensive idea of their pain points:
You can see that all these questions are open-ended. By asking these questions, you make the prospects feel valued and open up about their pain points. Once you know their pain points, you just have to show how your solution can fix their problems.
Do your sales and marketing teams bond well with each other? There should be some team-specific goals, but at the end of the way, both these teams should focus on increasing the sales volume for your business. Don’t forget that. That’s precisely why you need these teams to go hand-in-hand.
The marketing team is responsible for generating leads, while the sales team knows how to persuade the customers in converting those leads. So, strong communication between these two teams can bring wonderful results for your business. ‍
Sales teams should master their time management skills to increase business volume. A structured approach to time management can help to maximize results. Sales managers should make a list of all actionable items like cold calling, coaching the reps, prospect research, performance analysis, etc. Once that’s done, they should allocate time for each of these activities to reduce the scope overlapping.
The core idea behind time management is to make efficient use of time i.e. do more in the same amount of time or do the same work in less time. Also, the targets should be practical and based on the rep’s potential. That means if you ask a new rep to complete 30 cold calls a day, they’ll freak out for sure. So, maintain a balance.
No matter what others say, word-of-mouth marketing is still a thing.
Some organizations leverage referral programs to trigger word-of-mouth marketing. They offer crazy referral bonuses, gift cards, etc. That is indeed a smart way to increase sales volume and uplift your customer base.
We strongly believe that building relationships with customers can also pay off in this case. When customers are happy with your service and support, they’ll surely recommend your products and services to others, even if you don’t offer a referral bonus. So, work on nurturing customer relationships too.
Ever wondered what affects sales volume? A major reason could be that you’re not offering enough reasons to your customers to buy from you! And what’s a better reason than crazy discounts? Discounts can serve to bring onboard new customers who may continue to purchase. They can also boost loyalty from existing customers. If you can put out generous offers and massive discounts to customers, they’ll seriously consider buying from you.
Discounts do not always mean offering flat price cuts. You can also target “Buy 1 get 1 free” offers, cashback offers, loyalty points, holiday discounts, and any other option that goes with your customers’ purchase intent. Also, know that you have to communicate these offers with your target audiences. Apart from your regular sales channels, you should also promote these offers on social media to make the most of them.
An underrated strategy to increase sales volume is focusing on existing customers. These customers know you well, they’re already fond of you, and they’ll definitely purchase from you if you offer what they need. In fact, existing customers’ purchase rate is 67% more than new customers. So, start working on your customer retention strategies to increase sales volume.
Here are some ways to incorporate customer retention strategies:
Wondering how to find new customers and increase sales volume? Never stop cold calling. Consistent cold calling keeps your sales pipeline full. Furthermore, reps who are involved in regular cold calling can also enhance their sales skills and expertise to improve sales volume.
Cold calling offers real-life exposure to the reps. It helps them to get familiar with customers’ expectations and handle objections better. We know that cold calling often gets frustrating. However, reps should never stop trying.
To speed up your sales process and ensure an increase in sales volume, you must use a sales enablement tool.
A sales enablement tool like Salesken can help you with the following:
Hence, with a sales enablement tool by your side, your sales volume is bound to improve.
One of the best ways to increase sales volume is by creating packages. Packaging is a great way to position yourself in the market. For example, if you create a package with one main product and a few complimentary products, customers will be interested in buying them. Rather than confusing the leads with too many options, offer personalized packages to maximize sales volume.
Motivated reps are key to increasing sales volume. And the best way to do that is buying offering regular incentives. There should be a flexible compensation structure to appreciate the hard work of the reps. However, some reps may not fulfill their targets. Sales managers should analyze their performances and suggest improvement strategies. Education, understanding, and appreciation is a better strategy than pressurizing the reps.
Setting sales goals can surely improve the productivity of your team, but make sure that you’re setting realistic and achievable targets. Your sales goals should be specific, practical, and data-driven. To learn more on goal-setting, check out our blogpost: 7 Smart Sales Goals to Set For Your Sales Team
You can also increase sales volume by launching strategic partnership programs. Find marketers or strategic partners who would be interested in your products; they can promote your products to their customers, and you can do the same for them.
Suppose you’re running a content marketing agency while your friend is running a web development company. You can refer your clients to your friend’s web development services, whereas your friend can refer you to their clients. This would be an ideal strategic partnership. However, this strategy to increase sales volume is very effective but only works for relevant products.
Increasing sales volume takes time and effort. If you’re a newbie, stay patient. Apply these strategies, and give them some time. Sooner or later, you’ll surely notice the changes.

Assume that you have developed a new product and it’s ready to launch in the market. You probably also have a sales and marketing strategy in place to distribute and promote the product. You’ve also planned to track certain KPIs to track the business performance.
But is that it? Will that give you the entire picture of how your product is performing in the market?
Not really! That’s precisely why you should understand and apply the concept of sales volume. Sales volume determines the number of units of a product you sell in a particular time period. Now the question is, how to increase sales volume?
This article will explain the concept of sales volume in detail along with the tried and tested strategies to increase it.
So, let’s begin! ‍
The concept of sales volume doesn’t focus on the financial gains from a product. Instead, it determines how many units of a product you sold. While estimating financial gain is essential, an insight into sales volume can help you identify business health to a large extent.
Marketers are often confused about their existing selling strategies and are clueless about how they should make adjustments to them. The sales volume metric helps their deep insights in that range and helps in making informed decisions.
So, now the question is how to find sales volume? Is there any particular formula?
Yes, there is.
Sales Volume = [ No. of items you sell per month * Necessary period ]
So, if you sell five books in a month on average and you’re trying to find the sales volume for a year, your sales volume will be = 5 * 12 = 60 books a year.
Here are a few strategies that you can apply to improve your current sales volume:
Increasing sales volume means selling larger units of a product. So, make sure that you know your products inside out.
These include having an in-depth idea of the key features, so you know what to emphasize. Knowing your product’s Unique Selling Point (USP) can help you stand out in the crowd.
Here’re some questions to consider for understanding the product better:
Once you find the answers to these questions, it will be easier to sell the products. ‍
Do you know your target customers? Do you have any idea what their expectations are from your products? What specific problem do they hope it will solve for them? Remember that 36% of customers are looking for personalization from their purchase experience.
So, it’s better that you research your prospect, discover their demands, and then approach them. Without a personalized sales approach, customers will hardly consider buying from you. Therefore, don’t forget to conduct in-depth research as it is one of the best ways to increase sales volume.
If you’re ready to increase your sales volume, start with assigning your top-performing reps to high-value prospects-- those whose purchase intent matches your product most closely and so are most likely to convert into paying customers.
Evidently, there’s a lot at stake when it comes to these high-value prospects, and you cannot risk losing them. So, it’s always a smart idea to assign experienced and top-performing reps to those prospects. They’ll know how to qualify such leads quickly.
However, the question is, how do you find out who your top-performing reps are? You can use sales analytics software like Salesken for that purpose. It can help you analyze the sales conversations of your reps to find out how efficiently they are nurturing and converting leads.
This could mean easier identification of your best-performing reps and employing them to handle high-value prospects.
Do you know of the concept of pain-based selling? Let’s simplify it for you. In the pain-based selling process, a brand interacts with prospects to identify their pain points.
Next, they try to convert these pain points into benefits for the prospects. It is one of the best ways to increase sales and business volume.
Here are some questions that you can ask your prospects to develop a comprehensive idea of their pain points:
You can see that all these questions are open-ended. By asking these questions, you make the prospects feel valued and open up about their pain points. Once you know their pain points, you just have to show how your solution can fix their problems.
Do your sales and marketing teams bond well with each other? There should be some team-specific goals, but at the end of the way, both these teams should focus on increasing the sales volume for your business. Don’t forget that. That’s precisely why you need these teams to go hand-in-hand.
The marketing team is responsible for generating leads, while the sales team knows how to persuade the customers in converting those leads. So, strong communication between these two teams can bring wonderful results for your business. ‍
Sales teams should master their time management skills to increase business volume. A structured approach to time management can help to maximize results. Sales managers should make a list of all actionable items like cold calling, coaching the reps, prospect research, performance analysis, etc. Once that’s done, they should allocate time for each of these activities to reduce the scope overlapping.
The core idea behind time management is to make efficient use of time i.e. do more in the same amount of time or do the same work in less time. Also, the targets should be practical and based on the rep’s potential. That means if you ask a new rep to complete 30 cold calls a day, they’ll freak out for sure. So, maintain a balance.
No matter what others say, word-of-mouth marketing is still a thing.
Some organizations leverage referral programs to trigger word-of-mouth marketing. They offer crazy referral bonuses, gift cards, etc. That is indeed a smart way to increase sales volume and uplift your customer base.
We strongly believe that building relationships with customers can also pay off in this case. When customers are happy with your service and support, they’ll surely recommend your products and services to others, even if you don’t offer a referral bonus. So, work on nurturing customer relationships too.
Ever wondered what affects sales volume? A major reason could be that you’re not offering enough reasons to your customers to buy from you! And what’s a better reason than crazy discounts? Discounts can serve to bring onboard new customers who may continue to purchase. They can also boost loyalty from existing customers. If you can put out generous offers and massive discounts to customers, they’ll seriously consider buying from you.
Discounts do not always mean offering flat price cuts. You can also target “Buy 1 get 1 free” offers, cashback offers, loyalty points, holiday discounts, and any other option that goes with your customers’ purchase intent. Also, know that you have to communicate these offers with your target audiences. Apart from your regular sales channels, you should also promote these offers on social media to make the most of them.
An underrated strategy to increase sales volume is focusing on existing customers. These customers know you well, they’re already fond of you, and they’ll definitely purchase from you if you offer what they need. In fact, existing customers’ purchase rate is 67% more than new customers. So, start working on your customer retention strategies to increase sales volume.
Here are some ways to incorporate customer retention strategies:
Wondering how to find new customers and increase sales volume? Never stop cold calling. Consistent cold calling keeps your sales pipeline full. Furthermore, reps who are involved in regular cold calling can also enhance their sales skills and expertise to improve sales volume.
Cold calling offers real-life exposure to the reps. It helps them to get familiar with customers’ expectations and handle objections better. We know that cold calling often gets frustrating. However, reps should never stop trying.
To speed up your sales process and ensure an increase in sales volume, you must use a sales enablement tool.
A sales enablement tool like Salesken can help you with the following:
Hence, with a sales enablement tool by your side, your sales volume is bound to improve.
One of the best ways to increase sales volume is by creating packages. Packaging is a great way to position yourself in the market. For example, if you create a package with one main product and a few complimentary products, customers will be interested in buying them. Rather than confusing the leads with too many options, offer personalized packages to maximize sales volume.
Motivated reps are key to increasing sales volume. And the best way to do that is buying offering regular incentives. There should be a flexible compensation structure to appreciate the hard work of the reps. However, some reps may not fulfill their targets. Sales managers should analyze their performances and suggest improvement strategies. Education, understanding, and appreciation is a better strategy than pressurizing the reps.
Setting sales goals can surely improve the productivity of your team, but make sure that you’re setting realistic and achievable targets. Your sales goals should be specific, practical, and data-driven. To learn more on goal-setting, check out our blogpost: 7 Smart Sales Goals to Set For Your Sales Team
You can also increase sales volume by launching strategic partnership programs. Find marketers or strategic partners who would be interested in your products; they can promote your products to their customers, and you can do the same for them.
Suppose you’re running a content marketing agency while your friend is running a web development company. You can refer your clients to your friend’s web development services, whereas your friend can refer you to their clients. This would be an ideal strategic partnership. However, this strategy to increase sales volume is very effective but only works for relevant products.
Increasing sales volume takes time and effort. If you’re a newbie, stay patient. Apply these strategies, and give them some time. Sooner or later, you’ll surely notice the changes.

According to statistics, only 13% of customers believe a sales representative can understand their needs.
Sales, in simple words, is conversation.
Successful sales conversations lead to a winning sales deal. But ask any sales leader what the most difficult part of their job is, and they agree that it’s sales conversations.
If you and your sales team are having trouble warming up and trickling down the sales funnel and wondering how to start a sales conversation, then you are at the right place.
A sales conversation is a conversation between a potential buyer and a sales representative, between two or more people, with the agenda of selling their product or service.
To have an effective sales conversation, your sales team must not only have a strategy in place to lead the call but also undergo sales conversation training.
It is a common myth that exceptional salespersons are born and not made. Sales can be learned. Moreover, not every sales representative is the same and there’s always room for improvement.
Regardless of opting for cold call techniques, social selling strategy, or even email reach outs, focusing on your prospects with dynamic sales scripts and personalisation goes a long way.
With potential buyers making their decision within minutes, it is imperative to have exceptional conversational selling skills to hold their attention and convince them to buy your product.
One of the most run-of-the-mill conversation starters in a sales call is spearheading the call with a sales pitch. We’ve all been victims of annoying and irrelevant sales messages. In addition, rehearsing a common sales script with every kind of customer is no longer effective too.
Sales representatives need to make a real connection with their buyers; you need to show them that your solution will genuinely solve their problem and not just be interested in pushing a sale.
Not every sales call will lead to a successful sale.
Understanding how your product or service will solve a potential buyer’s pain points is vital. Ensure you know what key features and benefits your product has to offer and understand the concept to the T.
When you focus on the benefits and not on features, you are assuring your clients that you truly want to solve their problems beyond just making your sale.
In addition, focusing on benefits will help them tick their checklist against their issue as opposed to iterating the features.
Let’s say you are selling a smartphone - talking about an array of its features will not help the customer visualise them. Instead, talking about how the camera’s capabilities, storage options, and excellent display features with a show and tell kind of demo will definitely aid the sale.
The old-school adage that “the customer is always right” doesn’t hold true anymore.
As sales reps, you are experts in your field. To get the most out of your clients, it is necessary to ask the right kind of questions, especially open-ended ones where the sales conversation flows easily. So, avoid asking dead-end questions that end with “yes” or “no”.
Open-ended conversations not only make the conversation engaging, but they also help you grasp the customer’s requirements. Questions like “What are your objectives?” and “How are you planning on using our product?” can also reveal crucial information about the buyer’s pain point and let you have a sneak peek into their organisation as well.
One of the key drivers to effective sales conversations is articulating a clear agenda of the call. Check with the client if this is okay with them beforehand to avoid roadblocks.
This way, you are in control of your call and accomplish what you want to achieve by the end of the conversation while making the customer feel that, in fact, they are in control of the conversation.
Setting an agenda not only helps you avoid distractions in between the call but also helps you stay focused and sell your product the right way.
Leverage sales talk technologies such as Salesken to set a plan in place by keeping track of important pointers on the dashboard and making use of the technology to assist you in your next sales call.
A customer who has done their research will inevitably bring up your competitor during the sales conversation.
It is imperative to understand that your customer is only trying to weigh in options and gauge what’s best for them. The biggest self-sabotage you can do is by speaking ill of your competitor in such calls.
According to research, whenever you bad mouth someone, your audience puts you in the same category. Do not mudsling your competitors. Instead, show and tell your buyers with definite differentiators and help them perceive their future with you vs your competitor.
This process not only instils trust in your client but also helps you stand out from your competition.
To avoid falling into conversation traps, you need to be prepared for tough queries. This will take a combination of conversational selling skills to perfect, but most importantly, be ready with relevant data to support your statements.
The key to any successful sale is the ability to establish trust between you and your potential client. If you can’t, then you are unlikely to make the sale.
Some ways to establish trust and help your customers come to a decision is by displaying proof of success with the right kind of data and trust factors such as testimonials, case studies, and general data on how your service has genuinely helped a customer.
This establishes proof of trust and helps them kickstart their decision quickly.
As sales representatives, we’re the experts of selling our solution to the buyer’s problem. But, the truth is, selling is more than just one-sided talking but more listening.
According to statistics, top performers boast a 46:54 talk-to-listen ratio, meaning they speak less than 50% of the time.
By listening more to your customers and not interrupting their train of thought every chance you get, you will discover valuable information, make stronger connections, and avoid rambling, in turn letting them know that you truly care about solving their problem.
To be a star performer, make the customer the center of your sales conversation.
With the right skill of listening, you tend to ask the right kind of questions that reveal the buyer’s pain points and their objectives which help you think from the buyer’s shoes.
As a sales expert, it is easy to check off your box and think that you have all the answers you need, but in reality, you’re only getting started.
Understand the customer’s pain points on all levels to comprehend the business implications of their problem, life implications, and how your service will solve this.
For instance, the potential client may need high-level integrations so the marketing team and the sales team can automate their work rather than spending all their time on manual tasks.
It is vital for you as a sales rep to listen to the buyer closely, jot down their pain points, and connect the dots with your solution to give them answers.
With complex accounts comes complex problems.
Deals that contain multiple participants in a sales call from the selling company are 258% more likely to close the deal as opposed to a solo rep during the entire sales cycle. In simple words, team selling works.
Top-performing salespeople typically join their CEOs, sales managers, product experts, and other important stakeholders in their sales calls. Team selling helps the potential buyer understand the crux of the issue, and provide them with solutions from the right mix of experts to establish their authority in the conversation.
No generic sales script works well for all sale conversations. To be human is to be personal.
In other words, personalise your sales conversation, including both written and cold conversations. Say goodbye to your generic templates and approach each prospect in a personalised way. This not only demonstrates professionalism but also establishes credibility and expertise.
Personalisation may be time-consuming, but it is worth it. Being human and relating to the buyer’s issues is always warmly welcomed.
Before you sell your product, you need to foresee your conversation by creating value in your prospect’s eye.
The best way to demonstrate this is to help them understand your expertise in the field by discussing the right parameters and providing them value with your solution.
Top sales representatives spend more time talking about business and value-related subjects than average performers.
Establish an organic conversational funnel by discussing the possible pain points and outcomes and proving why your solution is the right fit for them.
Subjects in this category include ROI, the buyer’s pain points, timeline and objectives, benefits, and so on.
Now that we have established what to do in a successful sales conversation, below are five tips to avoid in a sales conversation.
Talking too much and not giving the customer a chance to speak is a rookie error. Talking less and listening intently to the customer will help you detect the customer’s intent and unique requirements and iterate accordingly. It is key to a successful sale.
Although it is a good practice to give the best to your customer, overpromising with your solution is another common pitfall to avoid. If you end up talking to a skilled negotiator, they will recognise this mistake almost immediately and potentially exploit it. Know the value of your product, learn how to negotiate about it, and highlight the right benefits.
While it is completely okay to believe in your product and sell it accordingly, objecting to the buyer’s objections about shortcomings comes across as rude.
In typical sales conversations, it is common to face questions and objections about your product. Preparing for these questions beforehand helps you navigate them with ease instead of coming across as defensive or impolite and losing the client altogether.
As a salesperson, you have an agenda to close the sale; every interaction you initiate should reinforce this. Setting up a sales call takes a lot of effort, so when the prospect shows up, make sure you have the agenda for the next call and carry them through the steps. Always close the call with clarity on the next steps, so you are always in touch with the buyer and do not lose the intent to close the sale.
Although these tips sound like a lot to remember, with Salesken’s intuitive features built especially for successful sales conversations, you can scale your agenda to close the deal quicker than expected.
Sales conversation technologies help you keep track of all your agendas through minimal manual work and lets you focus on the right metrics to close the deal as expected. Book a demo today!

Understanding how your product or service will solve a potential buyer’s pain points is vital. Ensure you know what key features and benefits your product has to offer and understand the concept to the T.
When you focus on the benefits and not on features, you are assuring your clients that you truly want to solve their problems beyond just making your sale.
In addition, focusing on benefits will help them tick their checklist against their issue as opposed to iterating the features.
Let’s say you are selling a smartphone - talking about an array of its features will not help the customer visualise them. Instead, talking about how the camera’s capabilities, storage options, and excellent display features with a show and tell kind of demo will definitely aid the sale.
The old-school adage that “the customer is always right” doesn’t hold true anymore.
As sales reps, you are experts in your field. To get the most out of your clients, it is necessary to ask the right kind of questions, especially open-ended ones where the sales conversation flows easily. So, avoid asking dead-end questions that end with “yes” or “no”.
Open-ended conversations not only make the conversation engaging, but they also help you grasp the customer’s requirements. Questions like “What are your objectives?” and “How are you planning on using our product?” can also reveal crucial information about the buyer’s pain point and let you have a sneak peek into their organisation as well.
One of the key drivers to effective sales conversations is articulating a clear agenda of the call. Check with the client if this is okay with them beforehand to avoid roadblocks.
This way, you are in control of your call and accomplish what you want to achieve by the end of the conversation while making the customer feel that, in fact, they are in control of the conversation.
Setting an agenda not only helps you avoid distractions in between the call but also helps you stay focused and sell your product the right way.
Leverage sales talk technologies such as Salesken to set a plan in place by keeping track of important pointers on the dashboard and making use of the technology to assist you in your next sales call.
A customer who has done their research will inevitably bring up your competitor during the sales conversation.
It is imperative to understand that your customer is only trying to weigh in options and gauge what’s best for them. The biggest self-sabotage you can do is by speaking ill of your competitor in such calls.
According to research, whenever you bad mouth someone, your audience puts you in the same category. Do not mudsling your competitors. Instead, show and tell your buyers with definite differentiators and help them perceive their future with you vs your competitor.
This process not only instils trust in your client but also helps you stand out from your competition.
To avoid falling into conversation traps, you need to be prepared for tough queries. This will take a combination of conversational selling skills to perfect, but most importantly, be ready with relevant data to support your statements.
The key to any successful sale is the ability to establish trust between you and your potential client. If you can’t, then you are unlikely to make the sale.
Some ways to establish trust and help your customers come to a decision is by displaying proof of success with the right kind of data and trust factors such as testimonials, case studies, and general data on how your service has genuinely helped a customer.
This establishes proof of trust and helps them kickstart their decision quickly.
As sales representatives, we’re the experts of selling our solution to the buyer’s problem. But, the truth is, selling is more than just one-sided talking but more listening.
According to statistics, top performers boast a 46:54 talk-to-listen ratio, meaning they speak less than 50% of the time.
By listening more to your customers and not interrupting their train of thought every chance you get, you will discover valuable information, make stronger connections, and avoid rambling, in turn letting them know that you truly care about solving their problem.
To be a star performer, make the customer the center of your sales conversation.
With the right skill of listening, you tend to ask the right kind of questions that reveal the buyer’s pain points and their objectives which help you think from the buyer’s shoes.
As a sales expert, it is easy to check off your box and think that you have all the answers you need, but in reality, you’re only getting started.
Understand the customer’s pain points on all levels to comprehend the business implications of their problem, life implications, and how your service will solve this.
For instance, the potential client may need high-level integrations so the marketing team and the sales team can automate their work rather than spending all their time on manual tasks.
It is vital for you as a sales rep to listen to the buyer closely, jot down their pain points, and connect the dots with your solution to give them answers.
With complex accounts comes complex problems.
Deals that contain multiple participants in a sales call from the selling company are 258% more likely to close the deal as opposed to a solo rep during the entire sales cycle. In simple words, team selling works.
Top-performing salespeople typically join their CEOs, sales managers, product experts, and other important stakeholders in their sales calls. Team selling helps the potential buyer understand the crux of the issue, and provide them with solutions from the right mix of experts to establish their authority in the conversation.
No generic sales script works well for all sale conversations. To be human is to be personal.
In other words, personalise your sales conversation, including both written and cold conversations. Say goodbye to your generic templates and approach each prospect in a personalised way. This not only demonstrates professionalism but also establishes credibility and expertise.
Personalisation may be time-consuming, but it is worth it. Being human and relating to the buyer’s issues is always warmly welcomed.
Before you sell your product, you need to foresee your conversation by creating value in your prospect’s eye.
The best way to demonstrate this is to help them understand your expertise in the field by discussing the right parameters and providing them value with your solution.
Top sales representatives spend more time talking about business and value-related subjects than average performers.
Establish an organic conversational funnel by discussing the possible pain points and outcomes and proving why your solution is the right fit for them.
Subjects in this category include ROI, the buyer’s pain points, timeline and objectives, benefits, and so on.
Now that we have established what to do in a successful sales conversation, below are five tips to avoid in a sales conversation.
Talking too much and not giving the customer a chance to speak is a rookie error. Talking less and listening intently to the customer will help you detect the customer’s intent and unique requirements and iterate accordingly. It is key to a successful sale.
Although it is a good practice to give the best to your customer, overpromising with your solution is another common pitfall to avoid. If you end up talking to a skilled negotiator, they will recognise this mistake almost immediately and potentially exploit it. Know the value of your product, learn how to negotiate about it, and highlight the right benefits.
While it is completely okay to believe in your product and sell it accordingly, objecting to the buyer’s objections about shortcomings comes across as rude.
In typical sales conversations, it is common to face questions and objections about your product. Preparing for these questions beforehand helps you navigate them with ease instead of coming across as defensive or impolite and losing the client altogether.
As a salesperson, you have an agenda to close the sale; every interaction you initiate should reinforce this. Setting up a sales call takes a lot of effort, so when the prospect shows up, make sure you have the agenda for the next call and carry them through the steps. Always close the call with clarity on the next steps, so you are always in touch with the buyer and do not lose the intent to close the sale.
Although these tips sound like a lot to remember, with Salesken’s intuitive features built especially for successful sales conversations, you can scale your agenda to close the deal quicker than expected.
Sales conversation technologies help you keep track of all your agendas through minimal manual work and lets you focus on the right metrics to close the deal as expected. Book a demo today!

If you’ve been following us for a while, you probably already know that Salesken is on a mission to augment human intelligence and bring science to sales. We are passionate about our vision to help you MAKE EVERY SALE YOUR BEST SALE. Now, we’re delighted to expand in North America and take this mission global!
We recently raised $22 Million in our latest round of funding, led by M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund), and our existing investor Sequoia India also participated in this round. We are excited to use the funds to further develop and scale our category-creating in-call live sales intelligence platform.
We aim to help sales representatives and teams achieve peak performance and help every organization maximize revenue, conversions, efficiency and transparency. Our platform improves performance and revenue per sales representative by providing actionable insights on gaps in their sales conversations and also bridging the gaps with real-time cues to the reps.
Before founding Salesken in 2020, our founders Surga Thilakan and Sreeraman Vaidyanathan spent over a decade training over 20,000 sales reps. They combined their deep domain expertise of sales coaching with cutting-edge engineering and data science to build a product that has seen rapid global adoption over the past two years.
“With the increase in remote selling across industries, digital tools have become a must-have in the sales tech stack. We created Salesken to make selling scientific and seamless. Salesken transforms teams, providing visibility and actionable insights for higher productivity from day zero. We see onboarding times reduce by 2-3 months through live assistance to sales reps. The quality of sales conversions improve, and the top-line improves by 20-25% within a few months of use. This impact has seen us grow by over 300% last year. We look forward to growing internationally and collaborating with the best talent to help us in our journey of building a world-class product.”

We are thrilled to share that Salesken is a winner at the G2 Software Awards 2022!
We have been awarded:
This award is a major validation of our vision of bringing science to sales and helping you make every sale your best sale. The recognition comes right after another G2 recognition– just recently, Salesken was featured in the G2 Winter 2022 Report
SalesKen was recognised as a G2 Momentum Leader, with a Momentum Grid Score of 87.
🏅We were ranked #1 in the Relationship Index for the Conversation Intelligence Category with a score of 9.83 out of 10, which only one vendor in each category wins. Additionally, we were ranked:
G2 badges are extra-special because G2 rates products and vendors based on reviews from the user community, data aggregated from online sources and social networks. The awards are similarly special and prestigious, as they show that Salesken is a beloved mainstream product!
A BIG THANK YOU to our customers for your continued love and support, which has helped us win these recognitions and awards.
We built Salesken to be a tool as indispensable to a salesperson as Excel is to a banker, and it's wonderful to know that we’re well on our way there!
We help reps and teams thrive through state-of-the-art features like real-time cueing, call recording and summarisation, post-call analytics and actionable insights. Our CRM and QA automation eliminate manual, repetitive tasks, while revenue insights offer visibility on sales pipelines. Salesken can help reduce preventable losses and help anyone on your team replicate the success of your top performer!
If you’d like to learn more about us, please schedule a demo with us. We’re also hiring for a variety of roles globally, so do check out our Linkedin page for more information!

Another G2 Quarterly Report. And another BIG WIN for Salesken.
Salesken has swept every single category we have featured.
We have been recognized as a G2 Momentum Leader, with a Momentum Grid Score of 87.
We are ranked #1 in the Relationship Index for the Conversation Intelligence Category with a score of 9.83 out of 10, which only one vendor in each category wins.
Additionally, we have been ranked as a High Performer in the Conversation Intelligence Category (for the 7th quarter in a row!), Best Relationship, Easiest to do Business With and Best Support.
G2 rates products and vendors based on reviews from the user community, data aggregated from online sources and social networks. The fact that we have won in multiple categories is a testimony to the love and trust that users have in us.
Here’s what our users have to say about SalesKen:
A BIG THANK YOU to all our users for their continuous love and support.
The NPS measures the users’ satisfaction with the product and their “Likelihood to Recommend”. It is measured across multiple parameters, and Salesken has the highest ratings in every one of them. This is a significant achievement, considering that we are one of the youngest organisations in the Conversation Intelligence Category.
Avg. NPS for Conversation Intelligence Products is 77 (G2 Winter Reports 2022)
Salesken’s core mission is to help you make every sale your best sale!
Unlike typical conversation intelligence products, Salesken is not just a diagnostic tool to pinpoint shortcomings in performance. Sure, sales leaders can track their team’s performance, get complete pipeline visibility and know if individuals, and the team, are on track to meet their revenue goals. But Salesken provides much more:
With the onset of the pandemic mandated restrictions, reps may not have access to office PCs. With Saleken’s mobile app, the Reps can now call the prospects, schedule follow-ups, send messages, create new leads, and more, right from their mobile devices. The reps can move around while attending the calls, and read the cues from the mobile itself. The high degree of flexibility, coupled with unparalleled capabilities, has made Salesken a pocket-sized sales companion to sales reps.
Here’s what Susratha Singh, Associate Director of Customer Success at Salesken, has to say about her experience with the users.
“Reps were initially sceptical about Salesken. They worried it was a monitoring tool that might hinder their work. But as they saw how Salesken seamlessly integrated with their tech stack, the flexibility it offered, and how the real-time cues helped them close more deals, they have taken to Salesken big time. Even experienced sales professionals are amazed by the real-time capabilities and are asking for more cues to be added. I am least surprised with the high NPS. It is a reflection of what I see and hear on the ground. And as we add to our product offerings, I am confident that the user’s love will only increase”.

Enterprise software sales is tough. There are tons of big players out there who have already mastered the art of enterprise software sales. But that should not stop you from looking for new enterprise sales tricks and reaching out to larger numbers of enterprise clients.
Enterprise sales are all about reaching the right prospects with the right products. That’s when you can add the most value and gain expertise in the process of selling to enterprises.
This article will give you a clear picture of the enterprise software sales process, its importance, and the associated challenges.
The Enterprise software sales process is a lengthy one involving multiple phases and decision-makers where a business sells software solutions to enterprise clients.
An enterprise software sales process is more complex than a conventional sales process. Dealing with a large-scale corporate entity means the involvement of many factors like business impact, reputation, and a complicated deployment process.
Despite enterprise software sales being complex, there are many great reasons to pursue it:
If you’re a SaaS startup wanting to make it big, working with large enterprises can provide a great validation for the work that you do. Selling your software to enterprise customers like Apple, Adobe, Amazon, Cisco, or other industry leaders can help you scale quickly.
Large enterprises come with huge revenue growth opportunities. We’re talking about world-class companies here which earn billions. If your enterprise software clicks with them, there’s no looking back. These are high-paying enterprise clients who can zoom your revenue in the upward direction.
Once you work with top brands and they praise and recommend your services, you can easily build a credible brand image in the industry, which will help you in the long run and make it smoother for you to work with more enterprise customers.
There is no one one-size-fits-all enterprise software sales model that suits every brand. If you want to build an efficient enterprise sales model for your organization, you have to perform A/B testing to find out which model is the best fit.
Here are the three most common types of enterprise sales models that B2B SaaS brands most commonly use:
The core concept: This enterprise sales model aims to empower enterprise customers and help them make essential decisions at their own pace.
Ideal for: B2B startups with low-cost products and relatively low customer acquisition costs.
Benefit: This model empowers customers and reduces reliance on your support team.
The core concept: Businesses that require long-term relationship building often go for the enterprise sales model. This model focuses on the bigger picture and establishes long-term relationships with customers through lead generation and nurturing. Short-term profit is not the only objective of this model.
Ideal for: SaaS companies with premium software solutions should go for this model. If your software requires frequent upgrade, integration, and support, the enterprise software sales model is the right fit.
Benefit: It can get difficult to achieve success with this model, partly because it involves a long sales cycle with frequent back and forth. However, if you can successfully implement this model, the benefit is huge. It can retain enterprise customers for a long time with recurring profit opportunities.
The core concept: The transactional sales model is a combination of the self-service and enterprise sales models. This model involves a longer sales cycle consisting of both the marketing and sales teams. The idea here is that the marketing team will drive qualified sales leads, and the sales team will close those leads, followed by an onboarding process.
Ideal for: This enterprise software sales model is ideal for mid-level SaaS startups having expensive products and where more people are involved in the sales cycle.
Benefit: This model could really be helpful to high-level SaaS startups to drive quality leads and eventually convert them with efficient marketing tactics.
Are you wondering how to dive into the world of enterprise software sales? Here are three quick tips for creating an enterprise software sales model for your SaaS company:
The first step toward creating an enterprise sales model is ensuring a product-market fit. Does your target market actually have demand for the software? Or are you looking in the wrong place?
B2B SaaS startups may need a long period of time to figure out what the correct market for them is. But it is a must to identify your target market, the problem you’re trying to solve, and who your ideal customers are.
SaaS startups cannot target any lead in their sales pipeline solely based on assumptions. They need a data-driven approach to differentiate the high-intent leads from the low-intent ones. That’s the only way to free-up time and close more leads within lesser time.
But the question is how? SaaS startups can use a powerful sales enablement tool like SalesKen that can analyze customer-sales rep conversations to perform lead scoring. Such a platform can score the leads based on their intent and help you find out which leads are easily convertible. With such real-time assistance, it can be easier for SaaS startups to qualify the leads and convert them into paying customers.
When you’re trying to build a robust enterprise software sales model, highlighting the features of the software is not enough. For your sales process to be effective, you need to identify the customer’s pain points and offer them a solution.
The enterprise sales process is never a smooth one. There are some hurdles that every sales manager will come across. Here are the three biggest challenges that we can think of:
This has to be the most common challenge when dealing with large enterprises. World-class enterprises have multiple decision-makers for different functions. Hence, it is next to impossible for SaaS startups to expect prompt sales cycles. You may have to wait for weeks (and even months) to close a sales deal.
It is not easy to find the right enterprise clients, especially for early-stage SaaS startups. There should be an intent-demand match to figure out if you’re targeting the right customers. When that’s done, you’re one step ahead of building a perfect enterprise sales process.
If you want to target large enterprises, start with building an efficient sales team. Your sales team should be filled with skilled reps who are experts in converting leads into enterprise customers.
Building a strong sales team can be a daunting task. That’s precisely why you need sales performance software. An AI-based software like SalesKen can provide real-time sales assistance to your reps by analyzing their sales pitches. It can help each rep identify their individual strengths and weaknesses and adjust their sales strategies with the sales call best practices. Hence, reps can identify and apply unique rapport-building techniques to make the most of their enterprise software sales pitches and close more customers.
Here are three tips to succeed in your enterprise software sales process:
The secret to converting enterprise clients is building relationships. If you win your customer’s trust and nurture them with the solutions they want, you’ll open doors for a long-term commercial relationship.
Sales reps often treat the enterprise software sales process as a conventional one. They tend to push the enterprise clients to purchase from them, which is the wrong approach for your enterprise software sales process.
Remember that you’re dealing with experienced decision-makers here. They have tons of options to select from and budget is also not a roadblock for these enterprises. So, to convert these leads, businesses need a more organized approach. SaaS startups should start right from the lead generation phase and slowly continue to the nurturing and conversion stages to ensure that enterprise customers build trust in your brand.
Hurrying them won’t help you in any way.
No matter how good a sales rep you are, it is impossible to grab the attention of your enterprise customers if you don’t know the product you’re selling. Sales reps are responsible for making cold calls, highlighting the products' benefits, and delivering sales demos for quick conversion.
To perform all these activities, they must have a thorough knowledge of the product. In fact, reps should take the time they need to understand the product, its features, and its benefits. There should be no compromises in case of understanding the products or it may backfire the entire sales process.
You can create a crisp, engaging product pitch or tell a story to the leads as you slowly take them through your product’s benefits and how it can solve their pain points. Form your story with case studies and clear examples. Show your prospects how it can make a difference if they pick your product over your competitors. That way, you make your sales pitch more believable and increase the chances of conversion. A direct pitch may or may not work, but a story always leaves an impact.
The enterprise software sales process is complex, with several twists and turns. But once you get started with the apt enterprise sales model and strategies, there will be no looking back. Get started with the tips and strategies we provided, learn as you go, and iterate as per your requirements. SalesKen can help in your enterprise sales journey.

The sales team is the heart and soul of any company. After all, business success is typically measured in revenue numbers. However, building a sales team isn’t always straightforward.
Not only do you need to hire the right people, who have a real passion for selling, you also need to train and motivate them to be beasts in the market.
How do you build a sales team from scratch? In this blog, we’ve drafted a comprehensive guide on building a sales team that drives better returns and broken it down into 10 steps. Read on for more!

The kind of sales representatives you need to onboard largely depends upon your business model, the nature of products or services, target audience, and growth trajectory. You have to determine whether you need outbound sales representatives or inbound sales representatives or both. First, define your sales strategy, and then decide on the various tools and processes that will support your business growth.
Before hiring, define what your ideal sales team looks like. An ideal team is usually one where the manager doesn’t have to micromanage their team, where top performers train the newbies, where everyone on the team is well aware of the company’s purpose and the selling culture is ‘discovery-based'.
Next, figure out the number of sales reps you need to scale up your business. Hire those who have the skills and passion to steer your business in the path of increasing growth numbers. Look beyond educational background and go with the candidates who can be creative, can think outside the box, are thoughtful, curious, humble, coachable, and eager to learn the nitty gritties of sales.
Once you have hired the individuals to take your business forward, you need to prepare a well-defined sales process for them to take a prospect along the sales funnel effectively, from researching and prospecting to closing. Learn more about this subject through our blogpost Building A B2B Sales Funnel To Win More Sales. With the inputs of your sales team, the sales funnel will enhance over time. It’s best to map out the process by yourself initially. Adhering to the sales process ensures the representative’s overall performance success.
It is important for any sales leader to define various KPIs, both qualitative and quantitative, to measure the performance of a sales team. Communicate with your sales team with regards to the KPIs, so that they are well aware of the company's expectations, both in the short and long run.
Some essential KPIs to measure include: customer acquisition cost, sales growth, customer lifetime cycle, profit margin, and conversion rate. You will also love our blogpost: 7 SMART Selling Goals for Sales Teams
Hiring the right candidate is just half the job-- you have to train and motivate your sales team too. You can do it with the help of verbal appreciation, rewards, and incentives.
Create a strong system for training and onboarding. While this may seem time-consuming at first, it’ll give you an exponential return in terms of your quarterly sales numbers.
It’s the company’s responsibility to train their sales reps with the latest techniques and strategies to close challenging deals If needed, invite veteran salespeople with heaps of experience to give guest lectures to your sales reps. Better training is equal to better output.
AI in sales can help transform your sales by eliminating repetitive tasks, standardizing processes, engaging leads, personalising pitches, optimising pricing, scheduling tasks, and more! You’ll also be able to track and improve your team’s performance. Read our blog 9 Ways To Increase Software Sales Using AI to understand how software Sales can be improved using AI.
Collaboration is the core of your business and your sales team. There should be a robust collaboration platform for internal communication within the sales function and for communication with other functions in an organisation. For seamless sales conversations with clients there should be an availability of effective VoIP business phone service along with the cloud.
What makes a great sales team? The answer is clarity. Your team can’t perform if they don’t know why they’re doing something.
Give each individual in your sales team as much clarity as possible about everything from company objectives to individual targets and career paths. Build friendly rapport with your sales reps.
Did you know it costs a lot more to hire new salespeople and train them from scratch than to retain them efficiently? With each candidate, you’ve invested heavily in terms of recruiting and training. If things aren’t going in the right direction, instead of firing someone, which hurts both parties, work to correct the situation.
More often than not, it’s the organisation’s responsibility to improve the situation.
A culture based on fear and negative incentives is extremely toxic to employees and will ruin your business long-term. Make your employees feel comfortable and confident in every way possible, and lead with inspiration.
You can improve talent retention by providing great training, incentives and improving employee engagement. Promote the candidates internally based on their performance, which will in turn boost their morale.
Last, but not least, celebrate every deal! It’s not always about the money (though hikes and promotions can help!) - It’s also about making people feel valued. Create systems for celebrating the wins as a team. Not just the big deals, but the smaller successes too. For instance, noting if someone has improved their numbers or became more empathetic or better at objection handling.
Celebrating success serves as a powerful incentive to motivate others to continue working hard and close tough deals. This goes a long way in building a robust, confident, and successful sales team and should be at the heart of your long-term sales team growth strategy.
Building a sales team from scratch can be hard, with long training cycles and high attrition, but we hope the above steps help make your journey easier! Building a high-performing sales team can be made faster and easier with the right tools.
SalesKen leverages the power of AI to augment sales intelligence. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing can help reduce training time for sales reps, helping you build your team faster. Moreover, SalesKen’s post-call data analytics can help every sales rep become a top performer! So what are you waiting for? Book your demo now!

The sales team is the heart and soul of any company. After all, business success is typically measured in revenue numbers. However, building a sales team isn’t always straightforward.
Not only do you need to hire the right people, who have a real passion for selling, you also need to train and motivate them to be beasts in the market.
How do you build a sales team from scratch? In this blog, we’ve drafted a comprehensive guide on building a sales team that drives better returns and broken it down into 10 steps. Read on for more!

The kind of sales representatives you need to onboard largely depends upon your business model, the nature of products or services, target audience, and growth trajectory. You have to determine whether you need outbound sales representatives or inbound sales representatives or both. First, define your sales strategy, and then decide on the various tools and processes that will support your business growth.
Before hiring, define what your ideal sales team looks like. An ideal team is usually one where the manager doesn’t have to micromanage their team, where top performers train the newbies, where everyone on the team is well aware of the company’s purpose and the selling culture is ‘discovery-based'.
Next, figure out the number of sales reps you need to scale up your business. Hire those who have the skills and passion to steer your business in the path of increasing growth numbers. Look beyond educational background and go with the candidates who can be creative, can think outside the box, are thoughtful, curious, humble, coachable, and eager to learn the nitty gritties of sales.
Once you have hired the individuals to take your business forward, you need to prepare a well-defined sales process for them to take a prospect along the sales funnel effectively, from researching and prospecting to closing. Learn more about this subject through our blogpost Building A B2B Sales Funnel To Win More Sales. With the inputs of your sales team, the sales funnel will enhance over time. It’s best to map out the process by yourself initially. Adhering to the sales process ensures the representative’s overall performance success.
It is important for any sales leader to define various KPIs, both qualitative and quantitative, to measure the performance of a sales team. Communicate with your sales team with regards to the KPIs, so that they are well aware of the company's expectations, both in the short and long run.
Some essential KPIs to measure include: customer acquisition cost, sales growth, customer lifetime cycle, profit margin, and conversion rate. You will also love our blogpost: 7 SMART Selling Goals for Sales Teams
Hiring the right candidate is just half the job-- you have to train and motivate your sales team too. You can do it with the help of verbal appreciation, rewards, and incentives.
Create a strong system for training and onboarding. While this may seem time-consuming at first, it’ll give you an exponential return in terms of your quarterly sales numbers.
It’s the company’s responsibility to train their sales reps with the latest techniques and strategies to close challenging deals If needed, invite veteran salespeople with heaps of experience to give guest lectures to your sales reps. Better training is equal to better output.
AI in sales can help transform your sales by eliminating repetitive tasks, standardizing processes, engaging leads, personalising pitches, optimising pricing, scheduling tasks, and more! You’ll also be able to track and improve your team’s performance. Read our blog 9 Ways To Increase Software Sales Using AI to understand how software Sales can be improved using AI.
Collaboration is the core of your business and your sales team. There should be a robust collaboration platform for internal communication within the sales function and for communication with other functions in an organisation. For seamless sales conversations with clients there should be an availability of effective VoIP business phone service along with the cloud.
What makes a great sales team? The answer is clarity. Your team can’t perform if they don’t know why they’re doing something.
Give each individual in your sales team as much clarity as possible about everything from company objectives to individual targets and career paths. Build friendly rapport with your sales reps.
Did you know it costs a lot more to hire new salespeople and train them from scratch than to retain them efficiently? With each candidate, you’ve invested heavily in terms of recruiting and training. If things aren’t going in the right direction, instead of firing someone, which hurts both parties, work to correct the situation.
More often than not, it’s the organisation’s responsibility to improve the situation.
A culture based on fear and negative incentives is extremely toxic to employees and will ruin your business long-term. Make your employees feel comfortable and confident in every way possible, and lead with inspiration.
You can improve talent retention by providing great training, incentives and improving employee engagement. Promote the candidates internally based on their performance, which will in turn boost their morale.
Last, but not least, celebrate every deal! It’s not always about the money (though hikes and promotions can help!) - It’s also about making people feel valued. Create systems for celebrating the wins as a team. Not just the big deals, but the smaller successes too. For instance, noting if someone has improved their numbers or became more empathetic or better at objection handling.
Celebrating success serves as a powerful incentive to motivate others to continue working hard and close tough deals. This goes a long way in building a robust, confident, and successful sales team and should be at the heart of your long-term sales team growth strategy.
Building a sales team from scratch can be hard, with long training cycles and high attrition, but we hope the above steps help make your journey easier! Building a high-performing sales team can be made faster and easier with the right tools.
SalesKen leverages the power of AI to augment sales intelligence. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing can help reduce training time for sales reps, helping you build your team faster.

Are you being empathetic while making a sales pitch? Remember that selling your products/services is not your ultimate goal. Sales reps should also focus on building long-term relationships with their customers.
A good sales pitch should ideally be a combination of strategy and empathy. Don’t forget that at the end of the day, it is how fast you can build trust.
In this blog, we’ll help you find out why empathy is a must for your sales pitch and give you some tips to craft a good sales pitch from scratch.
The millennial and Gen-Z customers are well informed. They’re aware that brands perform cold calls or send cold emails to sell their product/service. And the result? They end up rejecting most of these calls or leaving most of these emails unopened.
So what is the way to stand out? How can sales reps get these prospects to hear them out? What if you have developed a state-of-the-art software solution? For your prospects, it is not an exception. The only way to clear out all the clutter and make a good impression, is to solve their problems. That’s when the need for empathy comes into the picture.
A good sales pitch is where the rep acknowledges the prospects’ pain points with empathy and offers them a solution to resolve those challenges. That’s what a winning pitch is.
Empathy in sales is all about placing yourself in the prospects’ shoes to understand their pain points from the core. Once you identify your prospects’ pain points, you can craft solutions to solve these and offer them an effective strategy. That’s an empathy-based sales pitch and it will definitely bring results.
Wondering how to craft a good sales pitch loaded with compassion? Here are a few tips:
The first step to creating a winning pitch is to change the reps’ perspective. Let go of the preconceived notions like, need to run a sales campaign and push the prospects with frequent triggers. Remember that forcing the prospects will only reduce your chances of winning a deal.
If your sales pitch sounds like - “You have to purchase this product”, without giving the prospects a reason to believe you, why would they show interest? Instead, try to converse with them, understand their pain points and make them believe that you’re trying to provide them with the right solution to solve their problem.
A good sales pitch tries to start a conversation rather than push the prospects to buy something in the first attempt.
Craft a sales pitch, read it, and then ask yourself: Does it sound like helping your prospect or selling it to him/her? If it sounds anywhere close to selling, you are not making an ideal sales pitch.
Lead generation and lead conversion are two major steps in any sales lifecycle. But do you know what connects these two phases? Lead nurturing. To nurture your leads, you have to be more empathetic.
You can ask questions like:
When you know the answers to these questions, you’ll also know if your product can help the prospects. Accordingly, you can adjust your pitch to sound helpful.
Nothing can beat the power of a good laugh! Humor can cheer up everyone and your prospects are no exception. So, try making them laugh and join them. Now by humor, we are not encouraging you to crack pointless jokes.
But you can always add fun elements to your sales pitch to provide your prospects with a little dose of humor. This can be a nice gesture and stay with the prospects for a long period of time. In fact, this small laugh can turn out to be a deal-breaker and help you close the deal. You never know!
Whether you’re an entrepreneur or a sales professional, it is obvious that you are proud of the product you’re trying to sell. You know that it took you years to build the product. But diving straight away to show the features during a sales call is not the right way of pitching your product/service.
Again, put yourselves in the prospects’ shoes. They don’t have any idea about your product. So, why would they be ready to invest in it? A bunch of rich features isn’t enough to convince the prospects. They look for the answers to the following questions instead:
So, during your sales pitch, replace the features with benefits. That’s another way to add empathy in a sales pitch. If you can show the prospects what you can do for them, they will be curious to know more. That’s how you make a difference and stand out.
Sales reps often fail to deal with objections. What they miss out on is staying empathetic. Now, it is hard to identify the common objection points and how you can deal with them. But if you do your research properly, you can narrow down at least 10-20 objection points for your target prospect.
Now, you can prepare an answer for each of these objections. These answers should be empathetic. Remember that ignoring the objections is not always the solution. What matters is that you’re acknowledging the objections and taking the right steps to deal with them.
To craft a compassionate sales pitch backed by empathy, you need the right set of information. The more information you have about target prospects, the better are your chances to write a winning pitch.
But the question is how do you find out more about the prospects?
Well, you can use Salesken, a AI-powered platform to leverage:
When your sales team has all these benefits, it becomes a lot easier for them to craft empathetic sales pitches that convert customers easily. If you’re planning to make an empathetic sales pitch to your prospects, don’t forget to get in touch with Salesken today.

When it comes to sales communication, verbal and non-verbal communication are equally important. In fact, 93% of communication today is non-verbal. So, if you don’t focus on conveying the right message, you may end up making or breaking a sales deal.
In today’s digital world, sales reps don’t always get the chance to communicate with each other in person, making it harder to sell. Thankfully, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) reshaping the business ecosystem, sales teams can leverage it to improve sales communication. In this article, we’ll tell you why AI is indeed the future of sales communication.
So, let’s get started.
Sales communication is the process of forming a sales team that is informed, motivated and productive. Moreover, effective sales communication encourages internal feedback within the team too.
Now, note that we’re not discussing the useful communication skills sales reps should possess here. Rather, we want to highlight how your sales team can build a communication network within the organization.
A successful sales communication process can keep the reps engaged in terms of the latest product updates, company updates, industry best practices, and any other information that can matter for the sales process.
An appropriate sales communication plan should include the following components:
‍By “source,” we mean who is the sender of a particular message? It could be the sales manager, VP of sales, or any other individual.
‍Who is the target audience for the message? It could be the sales reps or any other member of the sales team.
‍There should be a specific goal for each message you’re sending as a part of the sales communication process.
‍How urgent is the particular message? The level of urgency should also be an imperative part of the sales communication plan you create.
AI is no longer a new concept for businesses. With time, AI has evolved gradually and is successfully redefining different areas of business. The benefits of using AI in sales communication are enormous. With the strategic implementation of AI into sales, businesses can easily drive more growth opportunities.
Data is the most crucial asset for any organization. Thanks to website cookies, social media platforms, CRM tools, and more sources, businesses now have tons of data for each customer. The amount of data being uploaded daily is increasing at a rapid rate. By 2025, the daily data upload limit will reach around 463 exabytes.
Sales teams can hugely benefit from this large volume of datasets. With the power of AI, it is extremely easy to sort, analyze and visualize these datasets. It helps the reps to understand their customers better and expedite the lead generation process of an organization. That’s because, with these datasets, you’ll only connect with the right group of prospects who possess the intent to purchase from you. This further means prompt sales communication and a quick productivity boost for your internal sales team.
With the rise in remote work, crucial information has become siloed within organizations. There’s also a big gap in performance between top reps and the rest. It’s more important than ever for sales teams to work collaboratively rather than just competitively at an internal level. AI can help with this by facilitating key information across these silos.
When you have correct insights from the collected datasets, you can use them to coach the reps, help them sharpen up their sales pitches, and offer them actionable feedback to improve their performance. Isn’t that the purpose of an effective sales communication process?
We are yet to make complete use of AI for sales communication. However, looking at the near future, we can guarantee that the popularity of AI will only increase. As of 2020, 54% of organizations use AI in sales. The increase is as high as 155% compared to 2018.
If we continue along with the same trends, it is very likely that AI will continue to dominate the sales operations in 2021 and beyond. AI can reduce any repetitive activities that are part of your sales communication plan. With the robust growth of AI each passing day, here’s what you should expect for the future of AI in sales communication:
One of the primary aspects of sales communication is to improve internal communication styles to accelerate your overall sales. With AI, your sales team can easily achieve that goal. Here’s how:
Another AI-based trend that we’re most likely to observe in sales communication is the use of a sales enablement tool. A sales enablement tool can free up more time for reps by speeding up sales communication. Here’s how it can redefine your sales communication plan:
AI is one of the best things that has happened to businesses in recent times. Organizations continue to find more innovative ways to leverage the power of AI for fulfilling their goals. If you’re looking for an advanced way to improve sales communication in your company, It’s time that you make the most of AI.
An AI-powered sales platform like Salesken can help you develop an effective sales communication network backed by data-driven strategies and tactics.

You probably know about hard-selling and soft-selling if you’re familiar with B2B sales. Experienced sales professionals make smart use of hard-sell and soft-sell pitches to win more customers. However, have you ever tried to make a comparison between hard-selling and soft-selling?
The hard-sell is a direct approach to selling, whereas the soft-sell is a more subtle way to sell products or services. But it’s a lot more nuanced than that. So if you’re a budding sales professional, you must learn the basics of hard-sell and. soft-sell. That way, you can apply these concepts in your sales pitches.
So, without further ado, let’s get into the details of the soft-sell vs. hard-sell discussion with relevant examples.
The hard-sell is more of an aggressive way of selling your products and services. When a sales rep leverages on directness to close sales deals, that’s when we call it hard-selling. When a sales rep plans to take the hard-sell route, they tend to prepare strong and to-the-point sales pitches. The hard-selling approach works best when sales reps have only one shot at closing a sales deal or if there’s a short deadline. In these cases, creating urgency usually helps close deals faster.
The concept of soft-selling is completely different from that of a hard-sell. In the case of soft-selling, reps try to persuade the customers through a subtle pitch. Reps believe in an empathetic approach and they try to perform frequent rounds of trial and error to convert a lead. However, a soft-seller needs a lot of time to achieve success. Soft-selling techniques are employed when there’s no urgency or a pressing deadline or in cases where the sales cycles are longer.
Let’s find out more about hard-sell vs. soft-sell:
Hard-selling has some critical challenges. Here are a few that sales reps might encounter: ‍
Hard-selling may not click for reps all the time. If you’re a newbie and don’t know how to craft your hard-sell pitch, you’re very likely to alienate your prospects instead of converting them. Prospects generally don’t prefer the pressure associated with hard-selling. Hence, they can easily dismiss a hard-sell call without even listening to the pitch.
You may get a customer to buy your products or services with a hard-sell, but that’s typically a one-time thing. Repeat purchase is very rare in hard-selling. So, if you’re considering a hard-sell and soft-sell comparison, make a note of this challenge. Since hard-selling doesn’t focus on building relationships, customers don’t have any emotional connection with the brand.
Looking for a solution?
Want to master your hard-sell pitch? You need sales enablement software that can coach your reps and help them understand their strengths and weaknesses. That way, sales managers can figure out which reps can hard-sell better. Try SalesKen today and become a pro in hard-selling.
Soft-selling is a great long-term sales strategy, but it has several unique challenges:
In the case of soft-selling, relationship-building gets the highest priority. But is it easy to build trust? Not really! Approaching a client, researching their pain points, staying connected over multiple channels or following up so regularly can be overwhelming for sales reps. Also, you should be able to communicate with complete transparency, so that the prospects think of your brand as loyal and honest.
When soft-selling, closing sales deals can take time! You can never force your prospects to buy from you. You have to wait and keep following up with them for as long as they need to make a decision.
What if you’re nurturing leads that are not even ready to make a purchase? This is a very common challenge of soft-selling. The reps often end up spending a lot of time nurturing leads that are not valuable. The result is unnecessary delay and excess costs in terms of time, money and human resources.
Looking for a solution?
To avoid these challenges of soft-selling, opt for sales analytics software that can help you gauge a prospects’ intent. This way, reps can build their rapport up only with valuable leads and win more sales deals in less time.
SalesKen, a Sales analytics software can help you capture customers’ intent with in-depth visibility into a customer-rep conversation. Hence, you can easily understand which reps can pull off the soft-sell strategy better.
We hope you understood the primary differences between hard-sell and soft-sell. So, which strategy are you planning to adopt? Is it hard-sell or is it soft-sell or is it a mix of both? Let us know in the comments section!
Whether your sales reps are hard-selling or soft-selling, SalesKen can augment your sales reps’ intelligence by leveraging the power of AI. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing and post-call data analytics can help you close sales faster and easier than ever before. So what are you waiting for? Book your demo now!

Call metrics help to analyze call data and their tracking feature tracks the status of your calls. Advanced call KPIs provide you complete insights for areas of improvement which will improve your business performance.
The Importance of Call Tracking Metrics
The right data will give you a peek into your agent’s work process, time management, performance, and how their performance is impacting your business. They’re also key to iterating performance and setting goals for KPIs. Call tracking metrics are key to your business’ success.
Knowing the average call length per lead helps you plan ahead, saves you time, and helps call agents send a personalized message and solve customer queries in a professional way.
Not every call will be a legitimate one, so set a minimum call duration as a threshold a call must fulfill before it can be considered a serious lead.
The exact duration would depend upon your unique sales process. It could be 30 seconds or a 1-minute call, as per your prospect’s questions or requirements. But if your calls are not answered quickly, or prospects are kept on hold, it’s time to hire some more call agents or add some more shifts.
As per research from the Search Engine Journal, 65% of customers like to contact your business via phone only. Meeting customers through the right channel will help you improve your call center performance. Investing in a modern call tracking system allows you to track the metrics that provide valuable insights in real-time irrespective of your team’s location.

Sales acceleration tools and processes can simplify the sales cycle, empower sales reps to close deals quickly through impactful conversation and help enterprises make their sales processes more efficient. Sales acceleration refers to tools and strategies that help enhance the efficiency and speed of your sales processes. Leveraging innovative technology, buyers move through the sales pipeline more seamlessly. Such ‘sales enablement’ practices ensure that sales reps have the required access to resources they need to accomplish their goals, be it data analytics, marketing collateral, or coaching modules. All this makes sales processes accelerate smoothly.
Result-driven sales acceleration solutions provide valuable insights that both the marketing and sales teams need to build relevant interactions. They offer additional context to help accomplish immediate sales objectives. Sales acceleration tools identify the latest information needed to decrease the sales funnel and expedite the sales. Most importantly, sales acceleration aligns the existing information with business opportunities, segmenting buyers by the level of qualification to help sales and marketing teams up their productivity levels.
Here are 8 benefits that enterprises can leverage by optimally using the sales acceleration system:
1. Improved Sales Productivity
2. Leaner Lead Generation
3. Actionable CRM Data Insights
4. Sales Training by Experts
5. Improved Employee Engagement
6. Lead Scoring and In-Depth Research
7. Rethinking the Sales Funnel And Alignment With Marketing
8. Scaling with Automation
Sales reps’ productivity peaks when they are selling without the pressure of lead generation, sales prospecting, searching for marketing resources, etc. Their productivity directly impacts revenue as well. When sales acceleration tools enable sales reps to maintain higher productivity levels, they can more effectively contribute to the bottom line.
Sales acceleration automates the time-consuming process of research and of vetting prospects, which happens prior to the initial communication with a prospective buyer. Automation lets sales reps focus on selling rather than on the preliminary legwork. Faster lead generation enables faster lead distribution and nurturing and, ultimately, quicker sales.
If data is your goldmine, then CRM is your refinery. The latter fetch insights that require technical proficiency as well as time investment. Integrating the sales acceleration tools with your CRM aids your sales and marketing team to make effective use of data.
Sales acceleration technology converts CRM insights into actionable takeaways. Over time, CRM optimisation gets you better results in the form of sales gamification so that you can see when content performance metrics rise and prospective buyers become more receptive to reaching out.
Sales acceleration technology gives access to important learning resources to ensure education is imparted in the most ideal way. It is not good practice to skip the essential touchpoints and go too fast as it may hamper the customer experience, or reps may misread patterns that are key to maintaining positive interactions. By using sales enablement tools effectively, sales leaders can mentor their reps and help them enrich their skill sets.
Sales gamification ranges from traditional motivational strategies like competitions to real digital games popular in the industry. Using such tactics, sales leaders can promote employee engagement and cultivate top performers. Engagement is directly or indirectly connected to productivity. A motivated employee stands a better chance of not just achieving their own quota but also supporting other team members.
Giving sales professionals a big list of leads can overwhelm them. This is where sales acceleration software can eliminate the tedious guesswork by finding the right prospects well in advance. In addition, predictive analytics helps prioritise leads better so that reps’ time doesn’t get wasted.
The way lead nurturing models are built tend to not motivate prospects to move to the next level; the middle-of-the-funnel leads rarely reach the bottom. After automation and acceleration systems have been fully integrated into regular processes, sales teams often gain new insights, like the top of their funnel being too big. Sales acceleration tools help teams reimagine their sales funnel. Sales acceleration systems help reduce disparities and better align sales and marketing through a data-driven approach. This coordination is critical to converting leads.
Every sales acceleration system has a dash of automation that may cover anything from automating sales tracking to calling your sales representative to setting up birthday reminders of customers to follow up on previous interactions with prospects and leads. This makes the whole process of selling much easier.
To identify which sales acceleration tool best blends with your existing sales and marketing funnels, you need to:
Undoubtedly, sales acceleration has shown its business value to many SaaS and non-SaaS-based enterprises and has become a bona fide component of the sales and marketing toolkit.

Sales acceleration tools and processes can simplify the sales cycle, empower sales reps to close deals quickly through impactful conversation and help enterprises make their sales processes more efficient. Sales acceleration refers to tools and strategies that help enhance the efficiency and speed of your sales processes. Leveraging innovative technology, buyers move through the sales pipeline more seamlessly. Such ‘sales enablement’ practices ensure that sales reps have the required access to resources they need to accomplish their goals, be it data analytics, marketing collateral, or coaching modules. All this makes sales processes accelerate smoothly.
Result-driven sales acceleration solutions provide valuable insights that both the marketing and sales teams need to build relevant interactions. They offer additional context to help accomplish immediate sales objectives. Sales acceleration tools identify the latest information needed to decrease the sales funnel and expedite the sales. Most importantly, sales acceleration aligns the existing information with business opportunities, segmenting buyers by the level of qualification to help sales and marketing teams up their productivity levels.
Here are 8 benefits that enterprises can leverage by optimally using the sales acceleration system:
1. Improved Sales Productivity
2. Leaner Lead Generation
3. Actionable CRM Data Insights
4. Sales Training by Experts
5. Improved Employee Engagement
6. Lead Scoring and In-Depth Research
7. Rethinking the Sales Funnel And Alignment With Marketing
8. Scaling with Automation
Sales reps’ productivity peaks when they are selling without the pressure of lead generation, sales prospecting, searching for marketing resources, etc. Their productivity directly impacts revenue as well. When sales acceleration tools enable sales reps to maintain higher productivity levels, they can more effectively contribute to the bottom line.
Sales acceleration automates the time-consuming process of research and of vetting prospects, which happens prior to the initial communication with a prospective buyer. Automation lets sales reps focus on selling rather than on the preliminary legwork. Faster lead generation enables faster lead distribution and nurturing and, ultimately, quicker sales.
If data is your goldmine, then CRM is your refinery. The latter fetch insights that require technical proficiency as well as time investment. Integrating the sales acceleration tools with your CRM aids your sales and marketing team to make effective use of data.
Sales acceleration technology converts CRM insights into actionable takeaways. Over time, CRM optimisation gets you better results in the form of sales gamification so that you can see when content performance metrics rise and prospective buyers become more receptive to reaching out.

Your business is booming and the revenue numbers are soaring. Congratulations! But, at the same time, you’re struggling to keep up with the demand. Your sales team needs to scale up rapidly to convert every lead into your customer. However, it’s no walk in the park. Scaling a sales team too fast, hiring too quickly, or spending too much can cause your processes to break. Conversely, scaling too conservatively can be detrimental to leveraging a hot market. Scaling your sales organisation quickly and efficiently is an art, and in this article, we’ll share the top 6 tips on how to do it. Read on to learn more!
When it comes to sales, anyone can be a one-hit wonder by fluke. But scaling consistently is about creating processes, systems and structures. So, try and identify what’s worked or not worked in the past and what’s working now and create a plan.
Sometimes, scaling too fast may mean your processes fall apart and stop working. Having a plan and staying proactive can help you get ahead of it and prevent problems before they occur. For instance, several tools provide you numbers concerning revenue forecasts, based on which you can hire early. This helps you prevent any dip in revenue because of a lack of human resources. So, have a plan for the processes and systems in place, implement it, monitor your progress, and iterate accordingly.
Scaling quickly means less room for error when it comes to hiring decisions. You have to hire quickly and correctly, or you’ll have to deal with attrition later.
Apart from education and experience, you need to look for those who share your company values and will be a good fit. You also need diverse candidates with complementary skills, so they’ll learn from each other. It’s not about having a couple of rockstars on the team, but building a team of rockstars. And you can only do that if they’re team players who are open to sharing their wins and strategies, so the team as a whole can perform better. You may also want to check out our blog post which talks about building successful sales teams: Building A Sales Team: 10 Steps to Build Successfully From Scratch
Once you’ve hired the right candidates, you need to take responsibility for their training.
Regardless of your sales team’s scaling speed, it is your organization's responsibility to train them. Your personnel must have strong clarity on their roles, responsibilities and goals. Equip each individual with the right knowledge about the product or service they are selling. They need to be aware of it in and out, to confidently convince their buyer
When you’re growing your sales org quickly, you can’t control every single thing. Hopefully, your systems and processes mean at least some aspects of your organisation are on autopilot. You should still monitor your sales team, but with no micromanagement. Rather, your team should be self-managed and should be as low-maintenance as possible.
Data in sales can transform your sales team for the better. Data analytics is the indispensable component of a successful sales team that can help you figure out new opportunities which otherwise won’t be identified.
Even when you have a small sales team, keeping a close tab on the performance of each individual is hard. As you scale, it becomes next to impossible to do so manually. There are so many visible and invisible, small and big variables that affect sales performance. Tracking data will give you performance breakdowns so you can understand each step, and what exactly needs to be fixed.
Beyond the large goals themselves, focus on tracking the activities to achieve those goals too. This will break it down into smaller steps, take pressure off the reps and still present you with key metrics. For instance, there is a sales rep who brings a good number of leads every month. But, when you delve into the data, you figured out that these sales reps are closing the deals at a lower rate than other sales reps who get fewer leads but convert most of them. Knowing real numbers, such as Conversion, sales cycle, sales velocity, turn around, and activity numbers, will help you identify top performers and replicate it better too. It’ll help you know if you’re on the right track, what needs to change, minimise waste and optimise your resources better. It takes subjectivity and bias out of the equation and helps you scale more smoothly. Fortunately, in 2021, you need not have a bevy of data analysts, as there are AI tools like Salesken that do the job with utmost precision.
Using smart sales tech tools can be a superpower that helps you scale up! As you scale your team, an advanced sales tech tool including many CRMs can automate any ongoing, manual, time-consuming tasks and facilitate effective handover of tasks to new sales reps. There are several options in the market which can do much more depending on your organization’s size and needs, and several offer demos and trials before you commit. Organisations need to carefully choose which tool can become a part of their sales technology stack. You may find some of these in our blog post: 9 Ways To Increase Software Sales Using AI Scaling your organisation can happen faster and easier with the right tools. SalesKen leverages the power of AI to augment sales intelligence. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing can help reduce training time for sales reps, helping you build your team faster. Moreover, SalesKen’s post-call data analytics can help every sales rep become a top performer! So what are you waiting for? Book your demo now!

Your sales team needs to scale up rapidly to convert every lead into your customer. However, it’s no walk in the park. Scaling a sales team too fast, hiring too quickly, or spending too much can cause your processes to break. Conversely, scaling too conservatively can be detrimental to leveraging a hot market. Scaling your sales organisation quickly and efficiently is an art, and in this article, we’ll share the top 6 tips on how to do it. Read on to learn more!
When it comes to sales, anyone can be a one-hit wonder by fluke. But scaling consistently is about creating processes, systems and structures. So, try and identify what’s worked or not worked in the past and what’s working now and create a plan.
Sometimes, scaling too fast may mean your processes fall apart and stop working. Having a plan and staying proactive can help you get ahead of it and prevent problems before they occur. For instance, several tools provide you numbers concerning revenue forecasts, based on which you can hire early. This helps you prevent any dip in revenue because of a lack of human resources. So, have a plan for the processes and systems in place, implement it, monitor your progress, and iterate accordingly.
Scaling quickly means less room for error when it comes to hiring decisions. You have to hire quickly and correctly, or you’ll have to deal with attrition later.
Apart from education and experience, you need to look for those who share your company values and will be a good fit. You also need diverse candidates with complementary skills, so they’ll learn from each other. It’s not about having a couple of rockstars on the team, but building a team of rockstars. And you can only do that if they’re team players who are open to sharing their wins and strategies, so the team as a whole can perform better.

Once you’ve hired the right candidates, you need to take responsibility for their training.
Regardless of your sales team’s scaling speed, it is your organization's responsibility to train them. Your personnel must have strong clarity on their roles, responsibilities and goals. Equip each individual with the right knowledge about the product or service they are selling. They need to be aware of it in and out, to confidently convince their buyer
When you’re growing your sales org quickly, you can’t control every single thing. Hopefully, your systems and processes mean at least some aspects of your organisation are on autopilot. You should still monitor your sales team, but with no micromanagement. Rather, your team should be self-managed and should be as low-maintenance as possible.
Data in sales can transform your sales team for the better. Data analytics is the indispensable component of a successful sales team that can help you figure out new opportunities which otherwise won’t be identified.
Even when you have a small sales team, keeping a close tab on the performance of each individual is hard. As you scale, it becomes next to impossible to do so manually. There are so many visible and invisible, small and big variables that affect sales performance. Tracking data will give you performance breakdowns so you can understand each step, and what exactly needs to be fixed.
Beyond the large goals themselves, focus on tracking the activities to achieve those goals too. This will break it down into smaller steps, take pressure off the reps and still present you with key metrics. For instance, there is a sales rep who brings a good number of leads every month. But, when you delve into the data, you figured out that these sales reps are closing the deals at a lower rate than other sales reps who get fewer leads but convert most of them. Knowing real numbers, such as Conversion, sales cycle, sales velocity, turn around, and activity numbers, will help you identify top performers and replicate it better too. It’ll help you know if you’re on the right track, what needs to change, minimise waste and optimise your resources better. It takes subjectivity and bias out of the equation and helps you scale more smoothly. Fortunately, in 2021, you need not have a bevy of data analysts, as there are AI tools like Salesken that do the job with utmost precision.
Using smart sales tech tools can be a superpower that helps you scale up! As you scale your team, an advanced sales tech tool including many CRMs can automate any ongoing, manual, time-consuming tasks and facilitate effective handover of tasks to new sales reps. There are several options in the market which can do much more depending on your organization’s size and needs, and several offer demos and trials before you commit. Organisations need to carefully choose which tool can become a part of their sales technology stack. You may find some of these in our blog post: 9 Ways To Increase Software Sales Using AI Scaling your organisation can happen faster and easier with the right tools. SalesKen leverages the power of AI to augment sales intelligence. Our state-of-the-art real-time cueing can help reduce training time for sales reps, helping you build your team faster. Moreover, SalesKen’s post-call data analytics can help every sales rep become a top performer! So what are you waiting for? Book your demo now!

Negotiation is at the heart of closing sales deals. The goal of a successful business is not to make a single sale and move on, but to build a relationship. Good negotiations significantly improve business and establish long-term relationships, which costs a fraction of what a company has to spend on acquiring new customers. Negotiation techniques help increase the rate of closing deals, maintain the profit margins for your products and services, and stay a cut above your market rivals. But negotiation skills don’t improve overnight-- it takes practice overtime to get the best results.
In this article, we are going to share the most relevant sales negotiation examples and tips to implement in 2021.
Sharing key details and pricing of your product over email is okay, but negotiation is a big no.
Negotiation over email runs the risk of miscommunication, as email is one-way communication while a phone conversation is back and forth. The email negotiation gives your potential clients time to think and respond, which makes the salesperson lose control over the conversation. It also extends the sales cycle with multiple steps like the email being sent, read and ignored or responded to, and so on.
It’s far easier and faster to negotiate over the phone, as there’s a personal connection and the prospect is more likely to be convinced and converted.

One of the most important negotiation techniques is waiting for the right moment. But when is the right time to negotiate? Is it the first call, the second call, or whenever you have built a rapport? The truth is, the negotiation in many ways begins right from the very first second of the call. Even before you begin the actual negotiation, the sales rep must begin with one goal in mind which is a successful closure, and set the sales negotiation stage for the same. situational sales negotiation is a great way to improve your sense of sales timing and pace correctly is to understand the parts of the sales funnel to take your prospect through. Learn more about this through our blogpost Building A B2B Sales Funnel To Win More Sales.
Language matters. While ‘I’ and ‘We’ might sound about the same, they make a world of difference. ‘We’ is more formal, yet it’s personal and comfortable. There are a lot of places where ‘we’ is the right approach as it personalizes the interaction. However, the more comfortable approach that comes from ‘we’ can hinder the negotiation. It’s much harder for sales reps to do situational sales negotiations with ‘we’. So start with ‘we’ and switch from ‘we’ to ‘I’ during the negotiation phase.
If you mention ‘list price’ during the conversation, then expect the negotiation to last long, as the prospective customers know there is a great scope for negotiation. Instead, try saying ‘approved prices’. This way, buyers would know that the approved prices do not change easily and they will not spend a long time negotiating. The approval seems like the price has been discussed internally in the first place, and is the lowest in the market.
State your approved price and then pause for a second. Although the pause may seem awkward, it will allow your prospective customer to digest it. Don’t fidget or give into the urge to fill the awkward pause. Allow your prospect to respond to the price, and then take it from there. The negotiation is the best if you talk less at this point.
The rule of thumb is the three-second pause after sharing the price, to improve the odds of making a sale. You never know-- after the pause, your prospective client may say they’re ready to buy and no negotiation may be required.
‘With practice, you’ll master the art of the pause.’
“FAIR is the single-most powerful word in any negotiation.” -- Chris Voss, FBI hostage negotiator.
Humans crave fairness, right from the quality of the products to the pricing.
Use the F word deliberately and powerfully, and in a way take the deal to the next step. However, do not use the F word more than one time during the conversation.
In sales negotiation training, sales reps are taught not to ask their prospective customers to close. Customers are more immune to pressure tricks and this hard tactic rarely works anymore. In 2021, it may even have the opposite effect and be damaging to the relationship. Lead your potential clients to the finishing line, but let them take the last step and cross it. They may raise their concerns right away, or take several days or weeks. In the case of the latter, stay patient and be willing to answer any questions in a neutral, non-pushy way. Often, the decision is not just about how things might work for them, but about their emotions too. Either way, they must feel comfortable and in control of the discussion and it must feel like their decision matters. Make sure you handle the last leg calmly and with ease, leading your prospective customers from uncertainty to certainty.

Salespersons are no strangers to answering questions, and the team at SalesKen is no exception. But our team, like thousands of sales representatives across industries and geographies, have an edge - we use SalesKen. SalesKen makes sales scientific and leverages the power of artificial intelligence to increase sales success and revenues like never before!
With SalesKen’s advanced Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC), we don’t have to haphazardly guess what our prospects are thinking. Instead, we can quickly discern the real concerns of our prospective clients based on actual conversations. This allows our sales reps to stay prepared and proactively address them in the pitch.
Here are the most commonly asked questions prospective clients have about SalesKen:
Chatbots are but a rudimentary application of conversation intelligence technologies. They are a good first step to begin engagement with your website visitor-- providing simple, pre-defined answers to enquiries on the website and giving you insights into customer behaviour to lay the foundation for your sale. However, chatbots merely scratch the surface of conversational intelligence capabilities.
With SalesKen’s advanced conversation intelligence and artificial intelligence technologies, you can identify the leads with high purchase intent and those that need nurturing. You can analyse every conversation your rep has with your prospect, identify what went right and where they need help, to coach them to success.
Also, SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistant provides your reps with contextual battle cards to navigate conversations towards success.
Now, your reps can know if the Prospect is responding positively to the pitch and tailor their talking points accordingly.
SalesKen’s Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC) allows your marketing teams to know their prospects’ top concerns, prepare sales collaterals and run campaigns that can allay the concerns of your prospects.
Voice of Customer Analytics can also be used to better understand the needs of your prospects, and you can build your product roadmap based on the actual needs of your prospects.
A call recording software records the calls made by your sales reps and stores them like a library. Sure, some of them do transcribe the calls, but if you are a sales coach, you’d still have to read through the transcript for it to be useful for your coaching effort. You’d have to read through hundreds or even thousands of calls and be able to compare them, which is humanly impossible. So, call recording software breaks at scale.
But SalesKen’s Auto-Signal Detection Capabilities will help identify the key talking points of each call. You can compare top reps’ performance vis-a-vis other reps, learn how your top reps are tackling objections, and share the best practices with the team.
SalesKen’s Good Call Engine intelligently builds a unique call profile for your organisation. You can know the conversation snippets that positively influence your prospects’ minds, best responses to objections and assist your reps in real-time in closing more deals.
Also, after every call, your Reps can get real-time reports about the conversation. They can know the Pitch Score, which compares their call on a scale of 1-100 with other successful calls, better understand what went right in the conversation, and areas of improvement for the next conversation.
Sales teams are never homogeneous. The team can be broadly split into 3 categories:
💰 Usually, 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of the Reps.
Imagine if you could help your average and bottom performers become high performers. Popular sales-readiness platforms can only help in a basic way. They serve primarily as a Learning Management System, but can’t do much more. You can upload your training materials and coach your reps by providing bite-sized lessons, conduct quick assessments and help in onboarding new trainees. But what happens when the reps are faced with a tricky situation during a conversation with the prospect? Any fumble and the prospect is lost, probably forever.
What your reps need is the ability to course-correct, real-time.
With SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistance, your reps can get help in the form of cues while they are on the call with the prospect. Our state of the art Emotion-Detection Engine will help your reps know if the prospect is responding positively to the pitch and tailor the talking points accordingly.
This is what Sahil Singh, our VP of Sales, has to say about SalesKen’s software:
“Unlike other sales coaching and readiness platforms, Saleken provides insightful reports on every single conversation. Not only can I analyse the rep’s performance, but I can show them how they compare with respect to successful calls. Since everything is backed by data, the reps are also more receptive to coaching, and I have seen a marked improvement in their performance within a very short span of time.”
SalesKen offers a plug and play solution. You can sign up and start calling your prospects immediately. We also integrate with the CRMs, telephony and leading video calling tools. All you need to do is link your CRM or video tools with SalesKen, and you can continue having conversations with your prospects in the way you have been doing it all along.
The Real-Time Assistance (or cues) will appear as a pop-up in the same window itself.
With SaleKen’s mobile app, the reps can now call prospects, schedule follow-ups, send messages, create new leads and more, right from their mobile devices. They can move around while attending the calls and read the cues from their mobile itself. SalesKen’s high degree of flexibility, coupled with unparalleled capabilities, has made it a companion to the reps. The conversations will be stored on the cloud, transcribed and analysed in the SalesKen platform, and you can view the reports anytime you want.
Depending on variables like your industry, revenue and company size, the cost of a SINGLE LEAD could vary anywhere between $65 to $430.
When your reps are unable to convert prospects, you stand to lose this amount every single time.
And we aren’t even considering the loss of revenue, which is usually anywhere between 3 to 4 times the cost of the lead. Not to mention the time investment and its opportunity cost.
With SalesKen’s Conversation Intelligence Platform, your reps can close 74%* more leads.
You can now get 100% visibility into each and every customer interaction. You’ll know what your reps are doing right, identify areas where they are struggling and provide them with targeted feedback to improve performance.
With SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistant, your reps can get help in real-time, during their conversation with prospects, and navigate the conversations towards success.
Also, Salesken’s Salesken’s Deep Learning AI identifies the leads with High Purchase Intent and the ones that need nurturing. You can engage your leads at the right time with the right message to increase conversions. This can lead to a significant reduction in the length of your sales cycle and improve your topline.

Salespersons are no strangers to answering questions, and the team at SalesKen is no exception. But our team, like thousands of sales representatives across industries and geographies, have an edge - we use SalesKen. SalesKen makes sales scientific and leverages the power of artificial intelligence to increase sales success and revenues like never before!
With SalesKen’s advanced Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC), we don’t have to haphazardly guess what our prospects are thinking. Instead, we can quickly discern the real concerns of our prospective clients based on actual conversations. This allows our sales reps to stay prepared and proactively address them in the pitch.
Here are the most commonly asked questions prospective clients have about SalesKen:
Chatbots are but a rudimentary application of conversation intelligence technologies. They are a good first step to begin engagement with your website visitor-- providing simple, pre-defined answers to enquiries on the website and giving you insights into customer behaviour to lay the foundation for your sale. However, chatbots merely scratch the surface of conversational intelligence capabilities.
With SalesKen’s advanced conversation intelligence and artificial intelligence technologies, you can identify the leads with high purchase intent and those that need nurturing. You can analyse every conversation your rep has with your prospect, identify what went right and where they need help, to coach them to success.
Also, SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistant provides your reps with contextual battle cards to navigate conversations towards success.
Now, your reps can know if the Prospect is responding positively to the pitch and tailor their talking points accordingly.
SalesKen’s Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC) allows your marketing teams to know their prospects’ top concerns, prepare sales collaterals and run campaigns that can allay the concerns of your prospects.
Voice of Customer Analytics can also be used to better understand the needs of your prospects, and you can build your product roadmap based on the actual needs of your prospects.
A call recording software records the calls made by your sales reps and stores them like a library. Sure, some of them do transcribe the calls, but if you are a sales coach, you’d still have to read through the transcript for it to be useful for your coaching effort. You’d have to read through hundreds or even thousands of calls and be able to compare them, which is humanly impossible. So, call recording software breaks at scale.
But SalesKen’s Auto-Signal Detection Capabilities will help identify the key talking points of each call. You can compare top reps’ performance vis-a-vis other reps, learn how your top reps are tackling objections, and share the best practices with the team.
SalesKen’s Good Call Engine intelligently builds a unique call profile for your organisation. You can know the conversation snippets that positively influence your prospects’ minds, best responses to objections and assist your reps in real-time in closing more deals.
Also, after every call, your Reps can get real-time reports about the conversation. They can know the Pitch Score, which compares their call on a scale of 1-100 with other successful calls, better understand what went right in the conversation, and areas of improvement for the next conversation.
Sales teams are never homogeneous. The team can be broadly split into 3 categories:
💰 Usually, 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of the Reps.
Imagine if you could help your average and bottom performers become high performers. Popular sales-readiness platforms can only help in a basic way. They serve primarily as a Learning Management System, but can’t do much more. You can upload your training materials and coach your reps by providing bite-sized lessons, conduct quick assessments and help in onboarding new trainees. But what happens when the reps are faced with a tricky situation during a conversation with the prospect? Any fumble and the prospect is lost, probably forever.
What your reps need is the ability to course-correct, real-time.
With SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistance, your reps can get help in the form of cues while they are on the call with the prospect. Our state of the art Emotion-Detection Engine will help your reps know if the prospect is responding positively to the pitch and tailor the talking points accordingly.
This is what Sahil Singh, our VP of Sales, has to say about SalesKen’s software:
“Unlike other sales coaching and readiness platforms, Saleken provides insightful reports on every single conversation. Not only can I analyse the rep’s performance, but I can show them how they compare with respect to successful calls. Since everything is backed by data, the reps are also more receptive to coaching, and I have seen a marked improvement in their performance within a very short span of time.”
SalesKen offers a plug and play solution. You can sign up and start calling your prospects immediately. We also integrate with the CRMs, telephony and leading video calling tools. All you need to do is link your CRM or video tools with SalesKen, and you can continue having conversations with your prospects in the way you have been doing it all along.
The Real-Time Assistance (or cues) will appear as a pop-up in the same window itself.
With SaleKen’s mobile app, the reps can now call prospects, schedule follow-ups, send messages, create new leads and more, right from their mobile devices. They can move around while attending the calls and read the cues from their mobile itself. SalesKen’s high degree of flexibility, coupled with unparalleled capabilities, has made it a companion to the reps. The conversations will be stored on the cloud, transcribed and analysed in the SalesKen platform, and you can view the reports anytime you want.
Depending on variables like your industry, revenue and company size, the cost of a SINGLE LEAD could vary anywhere between $65 to $430.
When your reps are unable to convert prospects, you stand to lose this amount every single time.
And we aren’t even considering the loss of revenue, which is usually anywhere between 3 to 4 times the cost of the lead. Not to mention the time investment and its opportunity cost.
With SalesKen’s Conversation Intelligence Platform, your reps can close 74%* more leads.
You can now get 100% visibility into each and every customer interaction. You’ll know what your reps are doing right, identify areas where they are struggling and provide them with targeted feedback to improve performance.
With SalesKen’s Real-Time Assistant, your reps can get help in real-time, during their conversation with prospects, and navigate the conversations towards success.
Also, Salesken’s Salesken’s Deep Learning AI identifies the leads with High Purchase Intent and the ones that need nurturing. You can engage your leads at the right time with the right message to increase conversions. This can lead to a significant reduction in the length of your sales cycle and improve your topline.

Identifying the exact variables in a sales conversation that ultimately convert prospects into customers is not an easy task. Successfully closing a sale depends on several variables— many beyond human control— like customer persona, the urgency of need, market conditions, sales representative, customer emotions and more. As many of these variables are hard to trace, it is not easy to identify exact reasons for sales success. However, doing so would help organisations improve performance, replicate sales success, stall preventable losses, and increase revenue.
At Salesken, bringing clarity by tracing these variables is one of the key problems we solve for.
The idea has been to generate actionable feedback for sales representatives to achieve their goals by giving recommendations on their sales activities, utilising:
Subjectivity is a fundamental problem in developing a heuristic system that reviews sales activity to tell the representative what works or doesn't. Such a flowchart and quality scorecard are subjective. Different sales experts can have different opinions about what might work for a certain prospect. This has thus far limited the kind of feedback that we provide to the representatives about what needs to be done to make a deal work.
There is a fundamental problem in trying to review a sales activity and develop a heuristic system that can then tell the representative what works and what doesn't. Such a flowchart and quality scorecard are subjective. Different sales experts can have different opinions about what might work for a certain prospect. This has thus far limited the kind of feedback that we provide to the representatives about what needs to be done to make a deal work.
Additionally, a lot of manual configuration is required. Sales leaders, who are adept with the script and processes, are often busy and unavailable.
The system does not adjust to the different sales associates who may have different styles of selling, does not change with time and needs excessive effort to adapt to a different team, product or to a slightly different use case and doesn’t accommodate diverse prospects who may have different needs and require different aspects of the sales script.
In SalesKen’s quest to solve these problems, we have developed a system which can do this in a highly scalable and automated way. We are training decision forests, on the signal tags that SalesKen already generates.These signals range from conversational, emotional, prospect-related and generic. You can read more about the signals we can catch on the conversations we analyse here. We are able to achieve as high as 90% accuracy in the models we have trained on these data points in predicting the results of leads based purely on these signals.
Using the predictions made by our models we are able to solve a very fundamental problem in sales pipelines. The pipeline stages have static conversion probability, which greatly limits the accuracy of revenue prediction. By employing the pitch score and lead win chance in combination, we are able to make the predictions on the revenue more accurate. Over time we have seen such systems getting quite certain about the cash flows. This allows Salesken to accurately predict the outcome of sales conversations and give our customers greater realistic visibility into their pipeline.
Keeping in mind the need to help our customers increase their sales, we set out to extract actionable insights from these mathematical models that can accurately predict the outcomes. What if the model could predict the least effort that could be made to drastically improve the likelihood of conversion of the prospect? It turns out that by deciphering where the model’s decision tree pushes the probability of conversion down the most, we are able to identify actionable insights out of these lead prediction models.
Along these lines, we are making Salesken Advisory more widely available. The key takeaways from Salesken Advisory are as follows:
These features work out of the box as soon as you start tagging the leads in Salesken as won/lost. You can use our already published connectors for CRMs like Salesforce, Zoho, LeadSquared and, Hubspot to start seeing this data today.
We are delivering Salesken Advisory information across multiple channels including WA, email, SalesKen device and web application to both sales leaders and sales representatives. We are segregating the advisory data at various levels-- sales activity level, prospect level, sales representative level and team level to be as specific yet comprehensive as possible. SalesKen Advisory data tells us what needs to be done at a specific sales activity level, and what needs to be accomplished at a macro level, like the team level. In our preliminary trials we have seen using Salesken Advisory producing as much as a 15% increase in monthly sales figures across teams and pipelines.‍
What does the future hold? In upcoming releases, we are focusing on three key areas:

The digitally connected modern buyer has various ways to gather the information that will influence their purchasing decisions. To seal the deal with this type of customer, a sales rep needs to adopt a customized and modern approach. One way to do so is to leverage the power of use cases.
But first, let’s look at the meaning of seal the deal or close the deal. It refers to deciding upon an agreement successfully. In sales, to seal the deal means the prospective customer has agreed to make a purchase. But this simple definition belies the fact that closing a sale is a very demanding job. To do so, every sales rep needs a selling strategy that generates wins even in an oversaturated market.
Do you want to know how to close a deal over the phone or in a virtual meeting? No matter what the setting is, the key is to incorporate these time-tested techniques into your selling strategy. Using these, you can convince even the most hesitant customer to give you a patient hearing.
Did you know that at least 50 percent of your prospects are not a good fit for what you sell? Finding out which customer deserves a greater portion of your time and energy helps you achieve a better success ratio.
A data-driven sales strategy leverages all the information in your system about every sales interaction and lets you better anticipate the needs of your prospects. Accordingly, you can determine which offers to promote and who will be your target audience.
Once you know your prospects well, you are aware of the challenges they face. When you approach the prospect, the proposition you pitch should address the unique challenges faced by the customer. It is best to offer solutions instead of selling the product.
Any prospect will compare your offer with those of your competitors before deciding. You might hear this question all the time too, "How are you better than your competitors?" While your reply should highlight the unique advantages of your product over that of the competitors, refrain from badmouthing them.
Budget objection is the primary reason why most sales fall through. But there are ways to overcome monetary constraints and have a less awkward conversation around the price. To close the deals effectively, it is better to work with the customer and find a solution that suits them, rather than pushing your product without understanding their limitations.
There are all kinds of customers, including those who are non-committal or even rude. While you can’t control their behavior, you can control how you react to them. Be pleasant yet stay firm, and do not show any anxiety.
Do not take it personally if a client shows reluctance to buy into your pitch. The best way to handle such a situation is to listen to their concerns and show them that you care. Once you identify their specific needs, you can leverage use cases to show why your product is just the right fit for them.
A use case is a scenario or a situation in which a product or service could be used to achieve a goal. Use cases vary according to the requirements for which a particular customer group has bought that product or service. In short, a use case helps you define your product according to the customer’s needs. When this is done keeping in mind the company’s messaging and strategy, you get the perfect new-age tool for closing sales deals.
Here are some ways in which you can leverage use cases to close even the hardest deals
Use cases allow customers to see all the ways in which the product can help them achieve their goals. This makes the product’s value more tangible and appealing for them.
Each use case is relevant for a particular segment of your target audience. So, you can use these use cases to identify the common goals of your target groups and tailor your messages to them accordingly.
By going through all the use cases of a product, a prospect can self-identify their requirements and even visualize new needs the product can meet.
If you were a customer, would you close a deal based on just facts and figures? Instead, a real-life usage scenario would be more relatable and enable you to understand the product thoroughly.
Unlike case studies, use cases are not limited to the experience of a particular customer. They highlight the solution provided to an entire industry or buyer type. Accordingly, each use case can prioritize a different need and include details unique to that, to make a short yet more compelling case.
Use cases are flexible and can be as simple or as detailed as you want them to be, depending on your target audience. Even minor features, which are not usually discussed in other sales collaterals, can be brought out here.
Use cases also envisage what might go wrong when a customer uses your product and provides relevant solutions. A prospect has the replies to any objections he might have before he can even raise them.
Use cases demonstrate the real-life usability and the functional capabilities of your product, adding to the confidence of your sales reps. It also acts as a guideline for the direction they need to go in and the most important features they should talk about.
For sales reps to be able to fully harness the potential of use cases, they should use these in conjunction with Salesken. Salesken is a conversational intelligence tool designed for salespeople. It helps detect crucial talking points and analyze the conversation in real-time. This lets sales reps adapt their presentation based on the prospect's requirements and decide the kind of use cases they would be most interested in viewing.
With Salesken, you can equip your sales reps with the expert knowledge required to close a sales deal successfully.

If you’re a sales professional or someone who is planning to make it BIG in the sales domain, one of the first skills that you need to master is the art of selling against the competition. A sales rep who is comfortable with competitive selling has much more earning potential in the long run.
The competition is intense in the sales domain, and learning how to deal with it will help you close more sales deals. Here, we’ve come up with some tried and tested strategies to help you get versed with competitive sales.
So, let’s get started.
Competitive selling is all about developing a sales approach that helps you defeat the competition in the long run. No matter what industry you’re operating in, there are always some competitors who’re closing more sales deals. To survive in this extremely competitive environment, you need some effective sales approaches.
Any prospect will evaluate your offerings with that of your rivals before making their purchase decisions. So, when your sales reps interact with your prospects, one of the most certain questions that they will come across is - “How are you better than your competitors?”
So, if selling against the brand is your ultimate motive, it is always better to train your prospects with such questions. Sales reps often try to approach the above question in any one of the following ways:
But, trust us when we say that neither of these approaches is right to handle this situation. Your competitors deserve respect. In fact, if you say offensive things about your competitors, that could create a negative impact for your brand in the prospects' minds. So, the art of competitive selling is to approach any such question smartly, without being disrespectful.
In the next section, we’ll explain some winning sales strategies to beat the competition.
Here are some not-so-obvious sales strategies that can work for you if you’re trying to sell against the competition:
When your prospect asks about a competitor, you should never respond with “I have never heard of them”. Such a response will likely make your customers feel like your sales reps are uninformed. Always do your research before any sales call to ensure that you have all the information on your competitors.
Research your strongest competitors— their background, their offerings, their product features, pricing plans, and any other relevant information that could come up during a prospect call. Once you have all this information, you can easily find out where your competitors are missing out and how you can highlight your value proposition to stay ahead of the competition. But again, don’t forget to stay respectful while highlighting your competitors’ drawbacks.
Whenever a prospect mentions a particular competitor, ask questions. Asking questions will help you understand the prospects’ expectations from your competitors. A seller in a competitive market should always be aware of the prospects’ expectations from their rivals before pitching their own products and services.
Here are some aspects to assess regarding your prospect’s expectations from your competitors:
If the sales reps can find these answers during a sales call, competitive sales can become much easier for you.
During a sales call, reps often point to pricing to convince the prospects that they’re a better alternative to their competitor. While that may work sometimes, we don’t recommend that strategy every time. Remember that prospects don’t always make their purchase decisions based on cost and discounts. Also, if you keep offering discounts to improve competitive selling, you may end up compromising your overall revenue.
Your sales reps should try to leverage your brand image and success stories to grab the customer’s attention. Reps should talk passionately about your brand, your past achievements, etc. This way, you’ll give the prospects some reasons to believe in your brand and its capabilities. In fact, you can win more sales deals in this way, without compromising on your revenue.
Winning and losing is part of life. What’s important are the key lessons that you take away from this failure. So, even though a prospect says, “No thanks! We’re buying from your competitor X”, you need to keep the doors open. You can always respond to this statement as “That’s great! If you ever face any inconveniences, don’t forget to contact us. We’ll be happy to serve you.” Keep the doors to the relationship wide open.
In some cases, your sales reps can even initiate a follow-up with these prospects after a month or so to understand their experiences with your competitors. If you can find even a pinch of inconvenience, you should be ready with your sales pitch.
There are few location restrictions in today’s dynamic world. What if you want to enter a remote market? In that case, you need to master competitive sales skills to beat the competitors working remotely.
Here are some strategies to start with:
When you’re competing with remote competitors, you need to approach it the right way. Your existing sales messaging may or may not translate in a remote context. So, it is always better to change or modify your sales messaging depending upon the target market and the changed situation.
Always remember that your remote competitors are already a step ahead of you in the remote markets. You can’t take their positions right away with hard-selling messages. The best way is to understand the market, the prospects, and their expectations. Once all these are clear, you can start pitching.
Since one-on-one meetings don’t really work in this case, you need to ensure that your sales reps are getting into remote meetings regularly. These remote meetings can help you understand your prospects better, learn their expectations from the competitors and develop sales pitches that can work in your favor.
Winning sales deals in a remote market is not easy. If you can’t be physically present in that industry, you need to invest in the right tools so that it seems that you’re always present virtually to ace the competition.
Here’re some types of tools that you MUST invest in:

An introductory sales call with a potential client can be like a first date with a person you’re interested in. It can make or break your case, as it’s your first and most important chance to make a lasting impression. There is so much to learn about each other during an introductory sales call, and sometimes, even when you think you’ve covered all bases, you could miss bits of information that are crucial to winning the prospect over.
According to HubSpot research, 58% of prospects want to talk about pricing on the very first call, while only 23% of sales executives are ready to do that. Similarly, close to 54% of prospects want to learn how a product works on the first call, while only 23% of reps are prepared to break it down. However, 42% of sales reps feel they don’t have enough information before making a call.
‍
Unless it is a cold call, 60% of prospects talk to sales reps only after researching their options. Whether they know you or not, keep your personal and company introductions short and sweet. If you don’t know how to introduce your business over the phone, remember that this is not a pitch. Instead of talking about features, talk about benefits or solutions. Maybe even add an interesting stat or an exciting value proposition to pique their interest right away.
67% of sales are lost to reps not qualifying their leads properly before taking them through the whole process. The first step is to know more about the person you’re talking to and figuring out if they are a decision-maker or can influence the decision-making process.
However, this doesn’t mean you start asking the person about their company or their designation. You can get that data from LinkedIn or their company website. Questions you can ask your prospect during an introductory sales call include:
The purpose of these questions is to understand if your prospect has both the motivation and the ability to sign the sales contract. It will also help you form a mental image of the person you are talking to and the aspects of your product that might matter to them. Find out what motivates your prospect
Once you know more about who your prospect is, it’s the perfect time to dig deeper into the numbers that matter to them. It’s also the right moment to start talking about the challenges they face and how these challenges affect the metrics they care about. These metrics could be anything, from lead generation to ROI, or sometimes even intangible things like how others perceive their brand.
79% of prospects want their sales reps to be trusted advisors. Understanding your prospect’s motivation will help you frame your solutions in a way that resonates with them. Here are some questions you can ask during an introductory sales call:
Once you know what your prospect cares about, get them to admit that they have a problem. Doing this achieves two things. First, it helps your prospect understand and articulate the urgency of their problem better. Second, it helps them accept that they need a solution to the problem, which is your cue to start building a business case for your product/service.
Once you’ve confirmed the challenges your prospect is facing, the next step is to establish urgency. Try and understand more about the numbers that this change will impact and if this challenge is a make-or-break factor in your prospect’s workday or business. Questions you can ask your prospect during an introductory sales call include:

An introductory sales call with a potential client can be like a first date with a person you’re interested in. It can make or break your case, as it’s your first and most important chance to make a lasting impression. There is so much to learn about each other during an introductory sales call, and sometimes, even when you think you’ve covered all bases, you could miss bits of information that are crucial to winning the prospect over.
According to HubSpot research, 58% of prospects want to talk about pricing on the very first call, while only 23% of sales executives are ready to do that. Similarly, close to 54% of prospects want to learn how a product works on the first call, while only 23% of reps are prepared to break it down. However, 42% of sales reps feel they don’t have enough information before making a call.
‍
Unless it is a cold call, 60% of prospects talk to sales reps only after researching their options. Whether they know you or not, keep your personal and company introductions short and sweet. If you don’t know how to introduce your business over the phone, remember that this is not a pitch. Instead of talking about features, talk about benefits or solutions. Maybe even add an interesting stat or an exciting value proposition to pique their interest right away.
67% of sales are lost to reps not qualifying their leads properly before taking them through the whole process. The first step is to know more about the person you’re talking to and figuring out if they are a decision-maker or can influence the decision-making process.
However, this doesn’t mean you start asking the person about their company or their designation. You can get that data from LinkedIn or their company website. Questions you can ask your prospect during an introductory sales call include:
The purpose of these questions is to understand if your prospect has both the motivation and the ability to sign the sales contract. It will also help you form a mental image of the person you are talking to and the aspects of your product that might matter to them. Find out what motivates your prospect
Once you know more about who your prospect is, it’s the perfect time to dig deeper into the numbers that matter to them.

Humans can hold meaningful conversations in complex setups with ease because of the ability to generate coherent responses to a given context. We seek clarification when in ambiguity, follow-up seamlessly with extended arguments, resolve coreferences and mentions, detect digressions and transitions, while still seeking the goal of the conversation, adapting to the changing conversational implicatures. While comprehension ability helps in understanding the context, it's the dialogue Generation/ management skill which forms the basis of a good conversation. Humans generate responses of diverse forms : a persuasive response to an objection, empathetic responses to distress, elucidation for vagueness , elicitation of information etc . An AI system which attempts to replicate or even augment human-level conversational skills, invariably requires powerful language generation capability in conjunction with NLU.
This blog will give you a 30,000-foot view of an AI technology called Natural language generation (NLG) that companies like Salesken use to augment human intelligence during sales conversations, aid in sales and revenue intelligence.
A very reasonable question you may ask is :
But what does all text generation have to do with intelligence? Is that creativity?
No, it's just some complicated nonlinear statistics.
NLG - a subfield of artificial intelligence, is a software process that automatically transforms data into vanilla English content. NLG has been a field of AI research for decades, but the most impressive and valuable advances in technology have only happened recently.
Text generation, which is often formally referred to as natural language generation (NLG), is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). NLG aims at producing understandable text in human language from linguistic or non-linguistic data in a variety of forms such as textual data, numerical data, image data, structured knowledge bases, and knowledge graphs. Among these, text-to-text generation is one of the most important applications and thus often referred as “text generation”.
When Salesken onboard a new organization, the team has to create Signals (Utterances you want to track) and assign them to proper dimensions (or segments) so that the Conversational AI engine tracks them whenever these are uttered during the calls (between the end Customer and the Agent). Often in Salesken, the team starts going through user manuals/documents and listens to a series of calls to understand what is being spoken between the Agent and the Customer and then creates those signals.
DIMENSION SIGNALS
I am your relationship manager calling from ICICI bankICICI directSingle platform to operate savings account and demat accountLife InsuranceCritical illness cover against 34 illnessHome LoanProvisional sanction letter granted quickly
The challenge with this approach is that
The solution proposed is a data-centric approach coupled with Machine Learning which will discover the signals. This discovery will start from semi-automatic to full-automatic as we mature this process. The final objective should be a self-learning system that will automatically discover these signals and assign the correct dimensions, which the Conversational AI engine can use to detect and track the signals from the calls made between the Agent and the Customer.
There are four components .
In this article, I discuss a few exciting applications of generative AI to help you create signals.
The main aim of the conversational systems is to return an appropriate answer in response to the user requests. However, some user requests might be ambiguous. In IR settings such a situation is handled mainly through diversification. A user is asking an ambiguous question (where an ambiguous question is a question to which one can return more than one possible answer) In Salesken, when we onboard a customer, both the customer sales team and the Salesken team sets signals which they want to track during the conversation between the Agent and the end customer. The signals are created by humans and they can be words, phrases or sentences. We use this model to generate multiple meaningful sentences of one phrase or sentence so that our conversational AI engine can track them during the conversation. Example for one of our Banking and Finance client:
This is an entailment encouraging text generation model to generate content for short phrases - It has been fine-tuned on a large corpus of English text (40 gb of data), which has learnt from various different domains and acts as a generic model for the generative purpose. In Salesken, there is an Ed-Tech client trying to see one of their educational products. The Sales manager wants to know if something is spoken about that product which deals with "Data Science Beginner" in the conversation. Our model creates meaningful sentences from this phrase which further gets detected by the search engine if there is a conversation on this during the call. Example for one of our Ed-Tech client:
Grammar Correction & Natural Rephrasing is the task of correcting different kinds of errors in text, such as grammatical and word choice errors. This model is typically formulated as a sentence correction task. This system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and is expected to transform it to its corrected version. This model has been trained in-house on large datasets (SNLI, RTE, PAWS, STS Datasets, Wikitext) after performing a great deal of NLP transformations like dropping auxiliary POS tags, lemmatization and inflexions. In Salesken, This model is such a utility model which we are using in every NLU/NLI pipeline as the conversational data by default is very noisy as it comes out of the ASR engine. Grammatical corrections of those sentences strengthen all the downstream tasks. Example of Grammar Correction and Rephrasing Model:
This model generates paraphrases which are helpful when you are creating a variety of sentences on one given topic. Then we rank them to remove the noise, and all different rankers like semantic and surface-level provide us with the flexibility to mould our model as per other use cases. At Salesken, we use this in Automatic Signal Discovery to generate and create multiple signals; by using this, we can eradicate the entire signal creation process, which is done manually.
In Salesken, this model generates generic signals (These signals are uttered in most of the conversation, which is done by the sales representative and the end customer), and it is fine-tuned on a dataset that is manually curated in-house by the annotators.
NLG models made available by us, can be utilised directly without the need to train , for many use cases. We have put together few models that can produce reasonable, believable, and engaging text in hardly any time at all. These models can be further fine tuned for the domain specific datasets. It really is incredible how easy this can be done when using the PyTorch and Transformers frameworks. To check out, NLP models open-sourced by Salesken, visit: https://www.huggingface.co/salesken
In this article, we present a comprehensive review of how we are using generative AI to create an automation of signal discovery which takes care of grammar correction, generation of sentences using keywords and paraphrasing of signals. The advances are likely to increase, and generative design techniques are likely to come into the core curricula of data science, creative, and engineering professions globally.

More than 40% of sales reps say closing calls is the part they dread the most. But a good close can be the difference between a deal won or lost. Are your sales reps making one of these 9 closing mistakes?
It usually takes a few rounds of communication to close a deal, which means not all calls need to end with a purchase. Know what to ask of your customer (and ask clearly) at different stages of the sales cycle – be it another meeting, a contact or referral, or a sale when it’s time.
Having a sales cadence may help you streamline and follow the different stages of your communication with your leads.
When you say something like “It would be nice to catch up with you again on this”, you are giving the customer a chance to say something nice and still not commit.
Instead, if you ask, “Can I fix a meeting with you for next Friday?”, they can only say ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
In about 63% of sales interactions reps don’t even ask for the sale!
You are wasting time if you are trying to sell to someone who
At least 50% of customers pursued are not even a good fit for what is being sold to them.
Avoiding this can be as simple as checking the LinkedIn profile of the person to whom you will be speaking, so you can get their designation, roles and responsibilities, and the decision-making power they wield.
Yes, if your company allows, you should offer discounts and offers. But going too low just to compel the customer to buy is a rookie mistake. You are diminishing your product’s perceived value causing your company loss.
Instead, persuade customers based on the problems you can solve for the customer and what could happen if they don’t solve those problems now.
Top reps spend 52% more time talking about value and 39% less time talking about technicalities than average reps.
There are three major problems with this.
Most sales reps have a higher talk ratio than their better performing counterparts.
Ditch the monologue and always pause after asking them a question. Chances are the awkward silence would get them thinking and give you what you need.
Valuable information includes factors that could instantly kill a deal (maybe a missing feature or incompatibility). If you can’t get the customer to mention such things soon enough, you would end up wasting your time and energy on a prospect that won’t even buy.
We’re not saying there is a specific time to ask, but keep these things in mind before popping the real question:
You must be persistent – tackle objections, offer solutions/advice, follow up, etc. But don’t try to argue with a customer or shove your product down their throats. You would come across as someone who doesn’t care to help and only wants to sell.
You could also address the elephant in the room by saying something like – pardon my insistence, but I wouldn’t be following up on this if I didn’t think we could genuinely solve one of your biggest problems.
Customers think about 50% of sales reps are pushy and only 3% would say they trust them.
You primed a customer, told them everything they needed to know, even piqued their interest, but alas! they hit you with a
“That sounds great, but we really don’t have the budget this year.”
“Maybe we could buy it when you bring out the data syncing feature.”
About 40% of sales reps give up after following up once. If you don’t follow up, you are willingly letting go of (possibly fruitful) opportunities.
Now that you know the things your reps could be doing wrong, let us also tell you what can reduce your efforts to get them to perform better – conversational intelligence.
CI analyses speech to show you what a good sales call consists of and how you can replicate the same across your team.
Salesken is a CI platform that doesn’t just analyze speech but uses the data to provide reps real-time assistance.
Salesken’s Help Zone displays relevant prompts that can help your reps keep conversations on track, provide useful answers, and understand customer intent.
What’s more? Salesken’s post-call analytics give you deeper insights into your team’s performance. Now you can update your playbook based on things that actually work and discard what doesn’t.

Sales leaders, like the rest of the world, have had a challenging 2020. Changes came rapidly, and they came in many forms. Looking back at the year, we are summarizing some of the major trends that sales leaders from across industries realize will shape the future of sales.
‍
Since most people are working from their homes, having face-to-face meetings with prospects is out of the picture for the foreseeable future. While inside sales reps are likely building stronger relationships with their customers, outside sales reps are struggling to cope with the transition to inside sales. To tackle this challenge, 70% of organizations are retraining their outside sales reps to fit the job.
A “report by McKinsey” also states that 74% of leaders believe the new digital models of selling are quite effective in reaching and servicing customers.
As decision-makers growingly warm up to the idea of spending larger amounts online, companies can capture more business by quickly adapting to remote selling.
‍
Video conferences are the closest thing to in-person meetings and are increasingly becoming the default mode of B2B sales communication in 2020. Consequently, revenues from interactions over video have risen by 69% since April, as customers prefer video to the phone.
89% of businesses believe these new models of selling will persist, making it a good idea to invest in video calling technology to continue communicating with your customers effectively.
‍
As per LinkedIn’s Global State of Sales Report 2020, many organizations realize the importance of technology to boost their sales team’s efficiency, with 90% of sales professionals deeming it very important.
‍
According to Salesforce, the following are the top 5 sales tools based on their popularity:
Conversational Intelligence, an increasingly popular subset of AI, helps sales reps have more productive conversations by providing them with deeper insights into customer data, behavior, and sentiments.
‍
Consumer behaviors and customer journeys are in flux. Thus, banking on data to gain insights into customer needs and pain points as well as to evaluate sales efficiency has become an absolute must today. Companies can create richer sources of data for their reps by integrating their sales and marketing functions. Experts believe, doing so give businesses an edge over their competitors.
According to LinkedIn’s report, nearly 5 out of 10 sales managers used data to assess sales performance and analyze patterns in deals lost.
Over half of them also used data to search for new customers and relevant industries to target.
‍
A shift from traditional sales models to more digital-centric ones require sales forces across industries to acquire the right skills to keep up with the changes. Salesforce says, in 2020, 62% of sales leaders used coaching and training tools. Also, 64% chose to re-skill existing employees.
According to LinkedIn’s report, top-performing reps were more likely than their peers to use sales tech and felt sales intelligence played an important role in increasing their close rates. The same report mentions that the time spent on social selling and inside sales courses more than doubled at the start of 2020.
‍
In 2020, close to 100,000 companies permanently shut down. Many others are still struggling to keep their businesses afloat. In a situation like this, to gain customers’ trust, it becomes more important than ever for salespeople to be empathetic and provide creative, more personalized solutions. The fact that 43% of customers say trustworthiness is the most important virtue they look for in salespeople shows just how important soft skills are in sales today.
‍
According to LinkedIn’s report, 76% of sales leaders believe that their ability to navigate change has become more important than ever. The more agile businesses are, the better they can deal with uncertainties and shifts in economic trends.
As sales teams prioritize customer needs and choose increased flexibility towards customers as their top priority, 60% of sales leaders exude confidence in their company’s growth strategy for the year ahead.
‍
Change is here to stay. The understanding and acceptance of this reality is the first step you must take to successfully steer your business out of uncertainties and help your customers tackle the challenges they face. With collaborative effort and the right use of technology, businesses will gradually create a place for themselves in the new normal.

Sales leaders, like the rest of the world, have had a challenging 2020. Changes came rapidly, and they came in many forms. Looking back at the year, we are summarizing some of the major trends that sales leaders from across industries realize will shape the future of sales.
‍
Since most people are working from their homes, having face-to-face meetings with prospects is out of the picture for the foreseeable future. While inside sales reps are likely building stronger relationships with their customers, outside sales reps are struggling to cope with the transition to inside sales. To tackle this challenge, 70% of organizations are retraining their outside sales reps to fit the job.
A “report by McKinsey” also states that 74% of leaders believe the new digital models of selling are quite effective in reaching and servicing customers.
As decision-makers growingly warm up to the idea of spending larger amounts online, companies can capture more business by quickly adapting to remote selling.
‍
Video conferences are the closest thing to in-person meetings and are increasingly becoming the default mode of B2B sales communication in 2020. Consequently, revenues from interactions over video have risen by 69% since April, as customers prefer video to the phone.
89% of businesses believe these new models of selling will persist, making it a good idea to invest in video calling technology to continue communicating with your customers effectively.
‍
As per LinkedIn’s Global State of Sales Report 2020, many organizations realize the importance of technology to boost their sales team’s efficiency, with 90% of sales professionals deeming it very important.
‍
According to Salesforce, the following are the top 5 sales tools based on their popularity:
Conversational Intelligence, an increasingly popular subset of AI, helps sales reps have more productive conversations by providing them with deeper insights into customer data, behavior, and sentiments.
‍
Consumer behaviors and customer journeys are in flux. Thus, banking on data to gain insights into customer needs and pain points as well as to evaluate sales efficiency has become an absolute must today. Companies can create richer sources of data for their reps by integrating their sales and marketing functions. Experts believe, doing so give businesses an edge over their competitors.
According to LinkedIn’s report, nearly 5 out of 10 sales managers used data to assess sales performance and analyze patterns in deals lost.
Over half of them also used data to search for new customers and relevant industries to target.
‍
A shift from traditional sales models to more digital-centric ones require sales forces across industries to acquire the right skills to keep up with the changes. Salesforce says, in 2020, 62% of sales leaders used coaching and training tools. Also, 64% chose to re-skill existing employees.
According to LinkedIn’s report, top-performing reps were more likely than their peers to use sales tech and felt sales intelligence played an important role in increasing their close rates. The same report mentions that the time spent on social selling and inside sales courses more than doubled at the start of 2020.
‍
In 2020, close to 100,000 companies permanently shut down. Many others are still struggling to keep their businesses afloat. In a situation like this, to gain customers’ trust, it becomes more important than ever for salespeople to be empathetic and provide creative, more personalized solutions. The fact that 43% of customers say trustworthiness is the most important virtue they look for in salespeople shows just how important soft skills are in sales today.
‍
According to LinkedIn’s report, 76% of sales leaders believe that their ability to navigate change has become more important than ever. The more agile businesses are, the better they can deal with uncertainties and shifts in economic trends.
As sales teams prioritize customer needs and choose increased flexibility towards customers as their top priority, 60% of sales leaders exude confidence in their company’s growth strategy for the year ahead.
‍
Change is here to stay. The understanding and acceptance of this reality is the first step you must take to successfully steer your business out of uncertainties and help your customers tackle the challenges they face. With collaborative effort and the right use of technology, businesses will gradually create a place for themselves in the new normal.

You may have come across this question several times in your sales career —Is sales a dark art or a science? It’s a question that solves only as many problems as it creates. Let’s spend around 3.5 minutes to understand, once and for all, which it is.
Some call sales an art because it requires the salesperson to influence the buying decisions of their customers. To do this, a good salesperson uses their emotional intelligence to strike a rapport with the buyer to establish a trust-based relationship.
Sales conversations are after all interactions between human beings, albeit for business.

Extensive studies, such as ‘Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Robert Cialdini, 1984), talk about the art of persuasion and influence.
Prof. Ben Shapiro and John J. Sviokla in their (Harvard Business Review) book, ‘Seeking Customers’ (1993) wrote, “Despite the tremendous contributions of information and communications technology, selling is still largely a function of interpersonal relations, which are guided by the artful ability to recognize motivations, needs, and perceptions.”
Such evidence points towards the idea that sales are an art.
First, while the ability to start meaningful conversations is considered an art—an innate gift — over time, we’ve learned that there are patterns to such conversations.
Today, you can learn to talk and behave in ways that can make you more employable. You can take courses to learn intonations and gestures that can improve your love life.
Leaders are trained to emulate certain words and actions that can make them more influential. Since all these conversations can be scientific, it is no surprise then that salespersons too can employ science to do their job well.
Successful sales reps use science-based formulae that combine social psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics when they engage with buyers. These sciences explain how and why people react the way they do.
So, it is not the higher EQ or IQ alone that makes salespeople successful. The idea of Sales as a Science comes from these scientific processes, methods, and approaches employed to close deals.
But the thing that tips the scales in the favor of sales being a science is technology.
Because the art of selling can be codified to make the buyer know, like, and trust the salesperson enough to buy from them ultimately, sales can be called science. Even the innate gift of starting a meaningful conversation has been codified in science-based tools, such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming, for salespeople to influence their prospect’s buying decisions.
Secondly, sales can be considered a science because it gets more right or less wrong over time, just like Edison said - “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”
Businesses have been spending even more on sales training, which is paying off – a recent report shows that every $1 spent on sales training returned $29 in incremental revenue. As there are controllable factors at play, science helps salespeople get better at their jobs. Science gives sales leaders (like you) tools to invest in their sales teams’ performance development to make improvement possible.
There are two primary reasons that current methods for assessing and improving sales reps’ performance are flawed.
In addition, you may recognize some of these common concerns you must address while coaching your teams:
📊 Three-fifth of buyers want to connect during the consideration stage after researching their options and arriving at a shortlist. 💳 One-fifth want to talk during the decision stage, having decided on the product to buy. 💵 So, most buyers want to cut to the chase and ask about pricing and how the product works in their first interaction with the sales rep.
👨‍⚖️ Majority (82%) of B2B decision-makers think sales reps are unprepared. 📄 According to the majority (61%) of buyers, providing relevant information is amongst the top four ways to create a positive sales experience. 😔 So, a lead generation campaign is likely to fail when a salesperson is unable to answer questions that are a desk search away. However, 42% of sales reps feel they do not have the right information before making a sales call.
👬 Your reps could be following every step by the book and saying all the right things during sales calls. But they may still not be getting the closures they were expecting. The reason this happens is because emotion is one of the toughest things to study and measure. Even if reps can understand the words being spoken, they can be thrown off by intonation, intent, pronunciation or even sarcasm.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the primary technologies that help bring science into sales. As sales trainers by profession, we’ve been thrilled to discover just how far AI can go to make a salesperson more effective. It’s not just about repeating behaviors that lead to success; AI can actually help sales reps acquire new skills.
Further, we’ve seen for ourselves that AI can actually make humans more human. When applied through Conversational Intelligence (CI), AI can make people better at an innately human thing – conversation – and assist them in decoding the most human of all things – emotion.
We built Salesken to leverage CI and provide two core benefits; for sales reps, this benefit is available through real-time prompts displayed on a Help Zone window that aids conversation and for sales leaders, this help is made available as a post-call analytics dashboard.
It decodes exactly what top reps do to help them win more deals. When you know what leads to sales success (for your product/service), CI can use this information to get the rest of your team up to speed by providing them with an updated playbook.
You need not refer just to a transcript of a sales call but an annotated set of highlights so you can selectively listen to objection handling, mentions of your product USPs, changes in customer sentiment, and more and hear both sides of the conversation.
CI can help your sales reps navigate chaotic sales calls by following the structured approach outlined in your sales playbook. It can help your sales reps push their prospects through the journey of the call in a tried and tested way.
CI can harness information from multiple sources – company databases, the Internet, past conversations, etc. – so you can customize your conversations based on data such as what stages of the sales funnel your customers are at. This way, you can reduce redundancies and avoid situations where customers lose interest because you are talking to them about things they already know – or worse – have no interest to know more about.
‍CI can help reps provide smarter responses to any question basis what’s had positive reactions in the past, from similar customers. Salesken provides this help in real-time – so sales reps can have more effective conversations. With practice, the salesperson’s anxiety, panic, and sense of powerlessness are replaced with confidence.
CI can help identify customer sentiments to engage them by tapping into their interests and emotions. Based on how a customer feels at any point during the sales call, you can tweak your pitch to reassure them or pique their interest. CI can also detect customer intent based on their emotion, so your reps know when the prospect is ready to buy.
We want to address one question we are often asked – Does CI replace sales training?
No, we don’t believe CI replaces sales training; we feel CI aids it.
As any sales trainer knows, acquiring the right skills is only half the job done. The other half is continually evolving by staying updated with what’s happening in the industry, in the company, and in the customer’s life. So, while sales training is an inextricable part of the process, CI leverages the power of science to ensure this evolution never slows down.
As a sales leader, if you are looking to overcome the inherent challenges of the sales industry and leave behind the idea that ‘sales is a dark art’, Conversation Intelligence (the foundation of our product Salesken) is the technology that can help make selling more scientific.

As the human attention span drops further (now down to 8 seconds), we realize it’s becoming harder to pay attention. Especially since the pandemic forced millions to work from home, your sales call is now usually just one of many other calls your customer has to take in a day.
Inspired by salespeople around the world, and educators who have to deal with distracted students in a new virtual world, here are some top tips to help you retain and regain customer attention on your next sales call.
Start the call with – “Hope you’ve had a chance to go through the documents I shared. From where would you like to start today’s call?” If they have perused what you sent over, it’ll save you time. If they haven’t, they’ll have to admit it. Being put on the spot will force them to pay attention.
It’s natural to zone out when you are just listening to someone else talk, be it on call or webinar. To help the discussion stay on track, break down the agenda into specific sections. At the beginning of each, mention what you will cover. After each section, you can ask the prospect to summarize what they understood or ask questions. Pro tip: If they don’t have any questions, repurpose some of the ones you’ve been asked before to discover further information. For instance, “We’ve earlier been asked if our solution is compatible with Google Drive – would that be a concern for you?”
A great way to break the flow and involve your prospect is by laying out a simple task for them to do. It could be to open a website on their phone or answer a few quick questions before you proceed. Those few seconds of involvement can be a game-changer, much like quizzes and assessments at the end of lectures.
As much as you think your prospect wants to say ‘no’, it is better to talk to them when they are ready to listen than tarnishing your first interaction with hostility. Don’t sound apologetic and don’t ask a question. Instead, say: “If this is a good time to talk, I’d like to take a few minutes to tell you about the challenges your new venture is facing. I believe we can even help you solve [state specific problem].” Even if they can’t talk at that time, you can get them to promise you another time when they’d be willing to know more‍
If you don’t want your prospects to zone out while you deliver a pitch, make a conscious effort to keep your delivery dynamic and animated. If your video were on, you’d have an advantage – you could move your hands or facial expressions to build a connection. But over a call, your greatest tool is your voice. Modulate your tonality basis what’s being discussed to keep the conversation interesting – sound excited when pitching your product, express genuine concern if they are telling you about their problem, stop and congratulate them if they share a story of their success, or even just say, “It’s so great we agree!” when you reach a place of mutual understanding. Pro-tip: You may be calling to make a sale, but if you take a few minutes to improve your prospect’s day, they’d be a lot more enthusiastic to listen.‍
One of the top things that differentiate top-performing sales reps is that they ask questions at regular intervals throughout the course of the call, and not just at the beginning or end. This isn’t only helpful in need discovery but keeps the prospect engaged too.
Similarly, asking open-ended questions requires the prospect to think about and frame a coherent answer rather than simply say “yes” or “no”, which keeps them focused on the conversation. Rather than, “Do you currently use a social media planning tool?” say “How do you currently plan your social media campaigns?”
Studies show that it only takes 4 seconds before silence starts making people uncomfortable. If your prospect pauses before answering your question, chances are they were paying attention. And if you don’t pay attention, why should they? So, say: “So, you agree that our marketing tool helps you reach more people. Is there any challenge you feel it doesn’t address?” and just wait. Silence doesn’t just pull back the customer’s attention, it also urges them to open up and share deeper knowledge with you. 70% of the purchasing decision are attempts at solving a problem. If your silence follows an insight from the client, you have a higher chance of offering a solution they would be interested in.
And if nothing else works…
They may still find it difficult to retain a prospect’s attention. It’s not always easy to know what to say. Especially as an inside sales rep, when your voice and the words you speak are the only tools you have to interest a complete stranger.
In such circumstances, it can help to have a helping hand telling you how to have a better conversation based on what’s worked best for top-performing sales reps in the same situations.
That’s exactly what Salesken, a conversational intelligence platform, can make possible. Salesken, a conversational intelligence platform, analyses speech to detect emotion and meaning. It then uses that data to display relevant prompts on its Help Zone in real-time, so sales reps know exactly what to say (and how) to their customers.

Not even trained professionals can claim to make a 100% accurate assessment of human sentiment. Effective methods like reading body language and facial expressions too fail when communicating over phone or video calls.
Remember ! An emotion is a response to an experience, while sentiment is the belief or attitude that arises from emotion. For instance, if a customer is happy or in a good mood, that's an emotion. But if the customer is excited or impressed by your product, that is a sentiment they have towards the product. As a sales leader, there are important reasons to spend time analyzing customer sentiment, beyond metrics like talk ratio or closures:
Of course, measuring something as intangible and complex as sentiment is tough. But there is a way that technology can help transition from gut feeling to facts. The answer lies in Conversational Intelligence.

People see the world through their own lens. To change the way your customers look at things, you need to give them the perspective you have through context setting.
Context setting allows a sales rep to quickly answer the question “why are you calling me?” and thus build relevance. But it also allows a sales rep to answer the tougher, more pointed question, “no, why are you calling me?” by building a connect.
To ensure the prospect continues to move towards each stage of the sales cycle, you need to add the right context during your pitch. Context setting must span all stages of a sales call, but you will need to customize the content according to the stages of the sales cycle.
Let’s see how context setting can make closing B2B deals easier for your inside sales reps.
Consider this:
When you customize your pitch to the prospect’s purchase process, you get better results.
The kind of data your rep needs to detect the stage of the sales funnel your prospect is at is called Opportunity Data. This data directly maps the prospect's desire with the seller's action. Opportunity data can be:
The route to empathy starts with understanding the major challenges and anxieties your prospects face on an everyday basis.
“While I know your budget will certainly be strapped for a project like this...” or “Since you may be struggling to get together a team of your own…”
In Modern Family’s S04E20 “Flip Flop”, real estate agent Phil Dunphy and his clan take this a little too far. They attempt to convince a buyer that a house is perfect for him, full with a kickboxing gym and Black Hawks poster. But the intention was good – to build a connect by finding common ground.
If your sales rep can employ Haley Dunphy’s social media savviness to discover a common interest or two, it could add a jolt of familiarity to the conversation. Be it by peppering the sales call with references or building analogies related to that interest.
Sales reps often dig through content repositories to assemble their presentations. But such content is rarely customized for the prospect nor is it updated often. The best sales teams apply personalization to sales enablement content – bringing sales reps closer to the prospect through deal-specific, contact-specific, and campaign-specific data.
As a sales leader, it can get exhausting to train your reps endlessly without any tangible way to assess how much they’ve learned. Context setting is an important skill that can reduce customer responses like “yeah, that’s great, but this has nothing to do with me”.
Conversational intelligence tools such as Salesken enable your reps to have contextual conversations. When you integrate Salesken with your CRM, your reps have all the customer information they need in one place. In addition, your reps get real-time cues for better tackling of customer objections and changes in customer sentiment.
On your end, you have Salesken’s post-call analytics to effortlessly get deep insights into what’s working best (for your top reps), so you can replicate their success and update your playbook.

Looking to update the tech stack for your sales team? Don’t make the mistake of confusing chatbots for conversational intelligence. They’re the proverbial apples and oranges. Here are the two primary ways in which the two are different (and not even in competition).
We’re accustomed to seeking help from virtual assistants and chatbots. Google listens to us and answers our searches. Amazon Echo plays our songs when told to. Dom on Messenger places orders for us from Domino's Pizza. Chatbots have come a long way in understanding different languages as well and work well for inbound sales and to offer support. But how persuasive can chatbots be when we aren’t too inclined to engage with them, like customers can be in sales (especially outbound sales) scenarios?
How effective can chatbots be in communicating the true value of your product and your partnership to high-value customers? Especially if they’re outbound leads?
Though chatbots help in minimizing human effort and maximizing operational efficiency, they lack the social and emotional quotient to pick up on subtle cues which often hold the key to clinching large deals. Chatbots are great for first-level conversations where the dialogue follows a structured pattern; conversational intelligence takes over when the exchange is largely unscripted. For instance, a customer expressing dismay over poor customer service on two different occasions. Conversational AI’s ability to parse and understand human sentiment is perfect for inside sales where reps are often at a loss to interpret the customer's reactions or emotions in real time. Salesken, our conversational intelligence platform for sales reps, classifies emotional or sentiment signals in real-time. Our system has over 100,000 inferences allowing it to detect and decode various signals, from words to phrases to tonality to pitch, and then run it through multiple data models. Say your customer sounds low-spirited on the call. Salesken naturally scans for words that mirror these emotions. It can immediately recommend ways (sentences, phrases, words) in which your rep can be more empathetic to your customer during the conversation.
A chatbot automates human interactions. Specifically, simple and straightforward text-based conversations that are easy to predict and program. If you log onto a banking site or ecommerce portal, you interact with a bot to get the status of your order or ask for a refund or open a bank account. A chatbot thus replaces actual human conversation.
But conversational intelligence works with humans to make them better at conversation. In the case of Salesken, this intelligence is provided in real time. Salesken makes contextual information available to your sales reps with real time prompts. If your rep is asked how your product compares with the competition, the prompt immediately shows your rep the top differentiators. If your rep is asked how your product suits the customer’s industry, the prompt displays highlights of a relevant case study. Salesken can help overcome the very ‘to err is human’ situations your sales reps find themselves in. “Could you repeat your last question?” “Sure, can I get back to you on that?” “I’m not able to recall”. These are the kinds of roadblocks Salesken can help overcome.
Jump onto the bandwagon. The adoption of chatbots is skyrocketing, and you don’t want to be left behind. But when you’re looking for a way to leverage conversational intelligence, don’t settle for the apple (chatbots), when the fruit basket is up for grabs (Hi, we’re Salesken). To get started, read How Conversation Intelligence allows Sales Leaders to see the future.

A new world order seems to be emerging in the midst of the raging coronavirus. One of the most interesting outcomes of the new faceless contactless world is how enterprise sales are being conducted.
B2C Sales has been on an automation path for several years now. Earlier, if you wanted to order pizza, you’d walk into a pizza retail store, which then changed to dialing in a pizza - today we order on a food app. In the pre-covid world of B2B Sales, high maturity industries were rapidly shifting their method of sales from a field sales fleet on street driven model to an inside sales model ie selling over telephony or through video apps like zoom. In the US, pre covid the inside sales number was as high as 50% of all sales, with 2.8 million sales folks engaged in it. Industries adopting the phone/ video sales model were typically technology selling (lends itself to demoing software over the internet over a zoom call pretty well), banking financial services, edtech, hospitality, etc. However, the long extended lockdowns due to Covid has necessitated even traditionally field sales industries such as pharma, relationship banking and private wealth management, IT hardware etc to rapidly adopt the inside sales model.
How can traditional field sales industries adapt rapidly to the new world of contactless faceless selling? Here are some top tips:
Your team that was previously selling 1:1 inside offices of your customers will now need to do the same internally .
While there are significant inherent benefits of low T&E, better health for your staff due to reduced travel and food from the streets, it will be harder to stay on top of recall in the minds of customers. In the regular world, several sales leaders train through a watch and learn model, where the leaders attempt to replicate their behaviour patterns or winning sales strategies to the rest of the team. In the post covid world, it would be important to invest in deep training interventions which can now be done remotely, through mentoring on calls, recording successful calls/ videos and replaying the same to the broader team.
At Salesken, we work across a wide range of B2B customers and find that in most cases, there isn't sufficient Hygiene around sales conversation materials. We find that most sales teams do not actually maintain detailed objection rebuttals, details of USP, product features, discounts permissible on pricing etc. Consequently there is a wide chasm between product realities and what is pitched by the sales team. Often we find less than 10% of the sales team actually mentions all the key USPs identified by the product team to be so. Covid requires system hygiene around production of documented materials and systemic dissemination so that the whole team is on the same page.
Sales executives selling to customers or enterprises understand waiting. The days when one would wait for hours outside offices of potential leads for a face to face meeting long over. Wining and dining are no longer ways to build relationships with customers. In a contactless world, personalization of a conversation gets more difficult. Some quick tools to improve this would be to connect with potential leads on whatsapp, slack or any other online group where engagement can be created. You could also formalize the relationship by inviting key customers to speak on online webinars on related issues - earlier, it would be difficult to get potential customers to events but in the post covid world, attendance for online events is only a click away.
Building the right set of tools is fairly critical to run an inside sales or telesales motions. At minimum, the tools you need are: a) Cloud telephony that allows you to record and monitor the calls b) CRM software c) Conversation ai tools such as Salesken that provide you complete call visibility without actually listening to the calls and also cues your reps in real time on best call responses.
Price negotiations and payments will need to be done virtually through bank transfers. Collection of checks from a customer's office is now left behind in a rear view mirror.
Overall, we encourage enterprises with field sales to think of inside selling as a huge opportunity - 1:1 access to senior leadership with customers, ability to engage through multiple online channels and stay always connected, reduction in T&E cost with better health for sales staff and an enhanced role of marketing in the sales funnel.

Sales is a multidisciplinary function. To be good at sales requires understanding of business, economics, behavioral sciences and technology (especially for those in tech sales). The past decade has seen many books which have influenced the way managers and leaders approach their jobs. Here are 5 books from the last 5 years we thought were particularly useful for salespeople.
How do you judge someone whom your are interacting with for the first time? Do you blindly trust them? Is first impression always right? Macolm Gladwell illustrates with various instances - from Chamberlin's appeasment of Hitler to Bernie Madoffs' investment scandal - of how our biases influence our decisions. A must read for anyone who wants to get better at the art of decision making.
Why you should read it?
Learn how to objectively assess situations and make better decisions.
Who is a Leader? And what separates a good one from the bad? Jocko Willink, a retired US Navy Seals officer, shares how he handled a potentially career ending experience to emerge a Leader.Co-authored with Leif Babin, this book best illustrates what it takes to lead.
Why you should read it?
Know how leaders grow and behave under extreme pressure situations.
"Data is the new Oil" goes the cliche, but it isn't the availability , but how we use data that makes the difference! Tungus & Bein, draw examples from their own experiences and that of other industry-leaders to show how data can be harnessed to improve processes within and outside the organization. Read this to know how to navigate our data rich world.
Why should you read it?
Learn the utility of data and analytics in improving yourself at work.
Could negotiating with a kidnapper and negotiating a sales deal have anything in common? Apparently, a lot! Life is a series of negotiations - from buying a car to negotiating a salary - and Chriss Voss, from his experiences as the FBI's lead International kidnapping negotiator, shares techniques that helped him succeed. An international best seller, this is a must read for anyone looking to be successful in their professional and personal life.
Why you should read this book?
Fine tune your approach to deal negotiations and close more deals at higher values.
Why aren't you growing faster? What does it take to get to hyper growth? How do you sustain growth? Aaron Ross & Jason Lemkin, draw from the playbook of hyper growth companies and provide an effective template! This is an essential read for all those looking to create sustainable growth trajectories!
Why you should read this book?
Learn growth strategies from the best in the business.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but we feel that these books have had a big influence on the way we approach sales. Do let us know if you think we have missed out on others.

“I don’t see what your product could do for me”, says a prospect, “It is just too expensive”, says another. As sales reps, you face objections in every pitch and have probably tried some techniques to handle these objections. But, how effective are you in handling your prospect’s concerns?
At Salesken.ai we have the benefit of assisting and analyzing almost 1 million minutes of sales conversations every month. Our customers include companies in Education, Software, and the Financial Services industries. And their buyers are both businesses and consumers.
Our data shows that almost 1 in 3 of our conversations end without the sales rep responding or acknowledging all of their prospect’s objections, reducing the chances of deal closure and impacting the sales reps’ performance.
In both these techniques, reps treat the objections as a hurdle to be surpassed before closure, not as genuine issues that need to be addressed.
By analyzing how top reps handle objections better we found that there were 4 clear actions that they did more consistently when faced with objections. They are:
Sales reps often interrupt when an objection is raised, assume that this is what the prospect is about to say (Heuristic Bias) and provide ready-made answers. Our data shows that when talking to Top Reps customers spend 20% more time stating their objections. This is because these reps listen and allow the customer to complete their objections, before interjecting. Listening to the prospect allows you to understand the objection better and also shows that you care.
It also helps you prepare for your response. Acknowledging can be done using mirroring. Repeat the last few words (or the critical words) of the objection.
If a prospect says “I think this is way too expensive for us at the moment”, acknowledge with “I understand that you think the price is too high, in the current situation”. There could be two objections here and acknowledging them may help you see which one is more important (price or current situation)
The objections raised may be a smokescreen for something deeper. A price objection need not be about price, but the prospects’ inability to see value in the offering. This is an opportunity to probe further and verify the real concern.
Is the price too high because its over what the prospect had budgeted, or because somebody is offering a similar product/service for less?
Verifying the true cause of the objection will help you address your objection in the most convincing way. Our data shows that Top Reps follow up objections with probing questions almost 2 times more than the average rep.
Sometimes it's simple - objections about price can be tackled by ROI calculations straight out of your sales playbook (Reps using Salesken.ai would get these cues in real-time!). Sometimes, you may not have a ready answer. Even then it’s important to address the objection. You can say you do not have an answer and will consult an expert to get back to them. For objections like missing features or unsupported payment terms - you can accept that you cannot completely resolve the prospects concerns.
Either way, it’s very important to ensure an objection is addressed before the conversation is over.
We looked at our data and saw that the top reps address stated objections almost 50% more than other reps. It’s hard to determine if every answer was convincing, but just the act of addressing an objection seems to be a good sales practice.
Sales reps dread objections and view it as an obstacle to closures, but our data shows that the prospects who eventually convert raise a minimum of 3 objections. So the next time you face an objection, keep your fear at bay and use LAVA to seal the deal!

How many times has this happened to you? You are about to lay into your pitch and the prospect excused themselves? (or worse, hangs up on you!)
What could have possibly gone wrong?
In today’s world, every salesperson is desperately trying to get their customer’s attention, and they rarely have more than a few seconds to do so.
How then, does a good introduction to a sales call work? At Salesken.ai, we have the benefit of assisting and analyzing almost 1 million minutes of sales conversations every month. Our customers include companies in Education, Software, and the Financial Services industries. And their buyers are both businesses and consumers.
We found that 9% of all sales conversations last less than 10 seconds. Basically, how you open your sales call affects the chances whether the person on the other end of the line is going to want to hear more from you or not.
To make a good impression on every call, use these 3 tips, we’d like to call the 3P’s:
Sales is really about creating a relationship with the customer, and social niceties form the basis of this relationship. “Good morning Lisa” will have a much better effect than “Good morning ma’am”. Research regarding the psychology of calling people by their name shows that our brains become alert on hearing our name!
Personalization will help your prospects see the human side to you and influence their interaction with you in a positive way.
Always begin the conversation with a positive comment or anecdote like, “I’m very excited about our call meeting today” or “How are you doing today in this pleasant weather?” Talk about great weather, fun weekend plans, or even their local sports team winning a game.* That kicks most sales calls off on the right foot and sets a positive tone for the call. It leaves your prospect excited and curious to talk to you. Taking a little detour, from your planned pitch, to set the tone of the call will go a long way.
*Not a sports fan or a weather junkie? Don’t worry, Salesken’s real time cues will show you local weather, scores and more such information to help you in every call!
When you enter a sales conversation without giving it a direction, the customers sense it. Your prospect will lose interest, and may even end the conversation if they feel that their time is being wasted.
Instead of telling them that you have called to ‘check in’ or ‘touch base’, state a clear and justifiable purpose of the call. If there is a set agenda for the call, now is the time to reiterate it. If this is a cold call - explain why you’re calling your prospect. Sending the right message across in the start is essential, and will work in your favor. How? The prospect will know that there is a purpose of this call, and that you mean business.
Your sales pitch begins the second the conversation starts. Even if you are speaking with the same person for the 3rd or 4th time, the first 10 seconds can change your outcomes considerably. Personalization, Positivity and Purpose, remember these 3 P’s to make a genuine connection, and the opening can become the easiest part of your call because the objective is not to make the customer buy the product, but just to make them interested enough that your call goes on to the 11th second!

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all facets of everyday lives. It is no surprise then, that it has also impacted sales in a big way. For many sales teams - there has been a disruption to their way of working and their pipelines, as their customers grapple with the crisis.
What impact would this have on sales conversations? At Salesken.ai we have the benefit of assisting and analyzing almost 1 million minutes of sales conversations every month. Our customers include companies in Education, Software, and the Financial Services industries. And their buyers are both businesses and consumers.
Here’s a few interesting insights to come out of our analysis
Almost in line with the world’s interest in the Coronavirus epidemic, mentions of the virus spiked in sales conversations on our platform from Mar-10. Look at this chart of the number of mentions of coronavirus* per day on our platform.
No surprises really, but it does show, how much the crisis has taken over sales conversations
Sales Reps tend to talk about the epidemic a lot more than their customers

We split the mentions of the Coronavirus by Reps and their Customers. This threw up our first surprise. While there was an overall spike in mentions of the COVID-19 epidemic, it seemed that Sales Reps were mentioning it a lot more than their customers were (sometimes almost 3-4x more in a day). This may be due to an attempt to display empathy on the reps’ part. However, if you or your sales team is talking about something 4 times more than your customer, it’s unlikely to be a good thing.
There has been a smaller yet sizable spike in mentions of an economic recession
It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to a massive humanitarian crisis but our attempts to fight the spread of the virus, have also led to economic slowdown and uncertainty.
We looked at the mentions of the economy* on our platform for the same period (Mar 1 to Apr 30). And there was a spike in mentions about it from Apr-1. While the spike was not as steep as the one for coronavirus, the mentions continue to rise as of May 2nd It’s interesting how the conversation between sales reps and customers seems to be moving from the epidemic to the economic situation. (An economic downturn may be a more clear and present concern for many people).
Customers tend to talk more about the economy than sales reps
On splitting mentions of coronavirus by reps and customers, we got our second surprise. Mentions of the economic recession seemed a lot higher by customers than sales reps. And the gap in mentions has been more pronounced in the past fortnight. There could be mitigating circumstances, but it does seem like there are two separate ways that sales reps and their customers are seeing the current crisis.
In conclusion
It is pretty evident that the prevailing pandemic has impacted sales conversations, just as it has every other aspect of our lives. However, our analysis suggests that sales reps and their customers have interpreted the crisis differently. While reps seem to be mentioning the virus and talking about the spread of the COVID-19 virus, their customers seem more preoccupied with the economic impact of the pandemic.
It is also vital to ascertain what crisis you are being relevant to. Mirroring is a powerful technique to build engagement with your customers and prospects. Try and keep your pitches and conversations with your customers about the economy, if that is what they seem more concerned about.
Also, it is evident that in times of such massive change - the dynamics of sales conversations change, week to week. Within 2-3 weeks, we noticed a shift of concern from catching a disease to facing a slowdown. It’s important to keep tabs on the voice of your customer, more than before. You can get insights like this for your business. Just contact us to know how.

Sales Insight


table of content
VPs of sales tasked with hitting quota for the quarter ultimately rely on their teams making their numbers. When handling a sales team, we all see that bell curve distribution between the handful of stars that are absolutely crushing it, and the newbies on our team we have to nurture to productivity. It’s the men and women in the middle that we ultimately rely on to make the quarter’s number.
It’s precisely this cohort that presents the biggest challenge to sales performance management, and also its path to a whole new level of performance as a team.
Typically, mature sales organizations have 70% or more of their team clustered around the average sales quota performance number. Stars on the team beat the average by anywhere between 30%-100%. And that’s a sign that we’re probably walking right past a gold mine of easy wins. What techniques in customer engagement and solutioning make the difference between a strike-outs in the hands of the average team member and home-runs in the hands of our stars? It’s the mystery that makes sales success into a black art for the average rep, and frustratingly unpredictable endeavour for leadership.
Insights into the best practices of our stars, contextualized and shared with our average team members is an incredibly effective tool we could leverage to move the needle of our sales team performance.
A 10% improvement in closing the gap between our average performers and our stars would yield a huge 30% improvement in team performance! Here’s how it’d break down for a 10 or 100 person sales team.
Now that’s an easy win in theory, but as sales practitioners we’ve walked past that El Dorado because unlocking it has always been too darn hard! The very aspect that makes it a high RoI lever – the large number of reps in the middle – also makes it incredibly hard to fix it with the tools we’ve traditionally used to fix problems around performance – reviews, buddying and training – methods that just don’t work well at scale.
With the latest advances in Artificial intelligence, we finally have the technology to help us take a crack at this problem in a new way. Tools like Salesken listen in on every sales conversation and the Artificial Intelligence technology analyses every customer interaction to give you and every member of your team deep insights into what’s working, what’s not and what’s making the difference between being a Hall-of-Famer versus grinding it out in the minor leagues.
We’re excited to enable a generation of sales professionals with the tools to truly transform their performance and find quicker paths to success!

Being ranked #1 in the Relationship Index, across 8 different categories, is a testament to the LOVE & TRUST our users have for us.

24 badges across 9 different categories. What does it imply?

Salesken has been included in 9 different categories -
This is the highest for any product in the Conversational AI space.
This is an acknowledgment of the fact that Salesken has successfully Productized AI and that is finding resonance in the market.
Conversational AI has long been equated with chatbots, voice agents(Alexa/Siri) or at best to record, transcribe and derive basic insights on quantitative metrics (talk-time, number of calls dialed, talk-listen ratio, etc.)
But, Salesken’s AI engines can intelligently understand every customer-rep interaction across channels - calls, videos & emails - and provide insights across 14 different dimensions ( Empathy, Urgency Creation, Positive Energy, Need Identification, Decision maker, Price Negotiations, Lead Qualifications, and others)
With Salesken, it is now possible for sales leaders to understand how top reps build rapport, handle objections, identify their best closing techniques, and share the WINNING practices across the team in REAL-TIME.
Salesken has, within a very short-time, emerged as the Go-To solution for sales teams, for multiple use cases.
From sales coaching, engagement, QA, enablement teams, and of course call analytics, Salesken’s AI technologies have helped teams gain the edge.
Conversational AI has emerged as a major technology in the last 3 years and the inherent weaknesses in NLP algorithms has now been largely resolved.
It is now possible for humans to have intelligent conversations with machines, and this has widespread applications across sales and customer service use cases.
What sets Salesken apart is the fact that our AI engines can understand nuanced conversations and understand the true intent of what is being spoken. This helps frontline sales teams understand how the lead is responding to the pitch, and tailor the messaging accordingly to improve outcomes.
Additionally, Salesken can identify the patterns of successful calls - best discovery questions, ideal rebuttals to objections, best closing techniques and others - and help share this learning across the team in REAL-TIME.
With Salesken, you not just identify, but fix the gaps with actionable insights.
These capabilities have made Salesken the preferred choice among the tech stack.
Salesken is rapidly expanding across geographies and use cases.
We now have one-click integrations across multiple products (CRMs, EMAIL, Dialers, Sales Engagement Platforms) to capture and analyze every customer-rep interaction and provide full visibility to organizations.
And of course, our AI capabilities are constantly expanding, and teams can now get insights on multiple parameters and guidance on the best course of action.

#1 Sales Enablement Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Reduce onboarding time to ramp up the speed for new sales reps to structured training content and pre-recorded sales conversations with Salesken’s sales enablement software. Say goodbye to shadowing a sales manager on live calls. Review and analyze demo calls with tips and address coaching gaps to improve overall sales productivity and decrease ramp-up time.
Salesken provides data-backed insights and actionable strategies to help you identify training gaps from real sales conversations. Identify, analyze, and track coaching gaps to improve training and talking tracks of your sales reps and focus on sales enablement efforts to boost their performance and drive more revenue.
Even the best sales enablement programs can die quickly if no one is watching how sales use what’s been provided to them. It’s critical that sales management enforces the use of best practices, content, and tools in the sales organization. Salesken’s sales enablement software let you track if the content and assets provided are being used correctly or not.
Your program should provide salespeople with everything they need to engage and convert buyers. But what do you focus on next? Should you focus on detailed information about products and services? What about sharing best practices from top performers in the sales organization? How about the development of sales skills like delivering great presentations? Salesken equips you with the critical information needed to steer these questions and address objectives well to help you sell more and worry less.
Most sales training programs suffer from a fatal flaw and as a result, sales reps quickly forget what they’ve learned, the information they’ve received, the content, and tools they are aware of. With Salesken, make sales training a continuous effort by equipping your team with the right directory of sales conversations, personalized recommendations, and best practices throughout the year.
Tech-led efforts to improve sales enablement best practices such as efficient client communications also lead to major benefits for other departments within your enterprise. The best sales enablement tools give employees within these two separate divisions the solutions they need to collaborate effectively. No matter where in the world they may be, colleagues can share audience insights in real-time, send quality leads, and, importantly, provide the sales enablement collateral sellers need to close their deals.By allowing departments to work together, sales cycles can be shorter, organizations can produce the best sales content possible, and conversion rates and revenue can be higher.

Top sales leaders use sales coaching software to bring their teams up to speed - it’s backed with science, reasoning, and data. Salesken’s sales coaching software combs every customer conversation to bring you data-backed insights to coach your sales reps into superstars.
It's time for a new way to coach sales reps. ‍ Salesken walks you through your sales team's performance in real-time, making it easier for you to decide where the coaching opportunities lie for critical sales behaviors and deal-closing skills—even as the landscape shifts, or reps turnover. There’s no one way to sell—not even when it comes to the most important thing: closing a sale. But there are also lots of little things that can make a big difference in that process: like being ready when the client asks questions, having trust in your product or service, and knowing how to find the right words. Those are skills you can learn, but it can be hard to remember them when you’re busy with other critical sales activities. That’s where Salesken comes in. We believe that everyone should be able to close more deals by doing less work—and we’re committed to helping you develop the skills you need so that you can do just that.
Training and onboarding your sales reps might seem like an easy task, but it’s more than just that. Salesken’s sales coaching software allows you to share, track, and analyze the progress.
Do not waste time searching for feedback and coaching moments for your sales rep - it’s daunting and not always right! Salesken’s AI-enabled coaching software provides data-driven insights and recommendations for each rep across 14 dimensions and identifies key coachable moments.
Track how your team performs and responds to sales coaching with real metrics and see which rep is performing well and who isn’t with Salesken. Find areas of improvement for the team with scorecards for each rep that gets automatically surfaced with Salesken.
Reduce ramp time from weeks to days through a library of well-curated sales conversations for virtual shadowing. Salesken captures and records real-time conversations and picks up winning behaviors, creates best practices, and shares them across the team.
We understand how daunting it might be to motivate your sales reps to bring their A-game every day and close a great number of deals. Create a leaderboard to track the progress of sales reps and gamify the learning experience to streamline and realign learning goals.
Follow these three simple steps to watch the magic unfold -
Salesken captures and records every sales conversation right from the first touchpoint to delivering the right coaching recommendations.
Salesken keeps track of every single coachable path you take as a sales manager and see how it’s being implemented across your teams and where to focus next
Salesken’s AI-powered software captures every interaction to separate winning behaviors and replicate them to create success across your team.
Unlike other sales coaching software, Salesken does so much more than just coach your team. Salesken is a champion in delivering the right recommendations, automating mundane tasks, and helping you close more deals.
Replicate winning plays with AI-enabled recommendations and improve sales productivity by 85%!
Understand your pipeline right from the first lead to the drop-off, and conversion.
Learn what went right with every conversation to supercharge and imitate the best closing calls.

Our revenue intelligence software helps your team hit your targets with precision. Gauge the deals that have shifted their strategy with easy access to data and know where exactly to focus with metrics and KPIs to forecast better. Ditch age-old methodologies and forecast accurately with confidence.
Salesken’s revenue intelligence software brings visibility into the health of your pipeline by tracking every single customer interaction and analyzing and comparing your team’s performance to replicate winning trends. Leverage our robust dashboard and customize it according to your needs to fit your business model and goals.
Sales teams work really hard to get a deal moving from one stage to another, but what if some of those deals aren’t even real, to begin with? Revenue intelligence provides total pipeline visibility to help you understand if the right path is being taken to push the deal to closure, see if major decision-makers are involved in the process and if all objections are being handled well.
Most times, sales reps assume a deal is going great, whereas, in reality, the deal has been stuck in one stage for weeks together. Put two and two together and say goodbye to fuzzy decisions out of closed-lost deals and tackle every bottleneck present in your pipeline to get ahead. Receive timely alerts for every deal in the pipeline before it’s too late with assistance from Salesken’s revenue intelligence software.
Successful sales is a mixture of the entire team’s knowledge and expertise to help everyone succeed. Say goodbye to the days of flipping through excel training manuals and trying hard to remember a particular tip or trick. With Salesken’s sales coaching software, save more time, effort, and money with AI-enabled recommendations for each rep and streamline sales training across your organization.

#1 Conversation Intelligence Software
⚡



Winter 2023
Ranked
(Sept. 2022) by Software Reviews.









Onboarding new reps require a significant investment of time from sales managers and ensures they receive optimum quality training. A new sales rep must feel confident to be fully ramped up in their jobs. Salesken’s conversation intelligence provides a supporting onboarding experience with AI-enabled content cards and guides reps with accurate, relevant talking points at the moment instead of relying on sticky notes and static playbook.
Sales managers don’t have the time to join every sales call. Traditional call recording software does not have the ability to deliver real-time insights and recommendations and does not yield immediate results. Salesken’s conversation intelligence uses real-time call analytics with live talk time visibility to help them course-correct themselves, and track key moments to keep your reps focused on the customer instead of note-taking. The result is more immediate, and valuable, and boosts productivity.
Sales managers often lack the detailed insights required for specific, data-driven coaching since the data accrued often implement various, disparate systems. Salesken’s conversation intelligence helps sales managers scale their best coaches by providing coaching to all reps. It also eliminates surprises in critical calls and meetings by summarizing action items, notes, and bookmarks directly into your reps’ inboxes after the meeting. Backed by a one-to-many intelligent assistant, sales managers can spend more time coaching and providing impactful, actionable guidance to their teams.
Traditional sales tools only help sales managers identify the actions needed to make their top performers successful and their bottom performers unsuccessful. Salesken’s conversation intelligence helps managers to easily identify the performance category for each rep and offer clear insights into their top performers’ talk track, topics covered at each moment, time spent, questions asked, the ratio of speaking, and more to precisely tailor their coaching for average reps.
Reps commonly face difficult customer questions and objections and the only thing that sets one team apart from another is their ability to handle those questions well. A strong conversation intelligence software uses AI to analyze each conversation and categorize every prospect response and serve content cards that prompt reps with the correct talking points to offer real-time support and determine the best practices to support their team.

Despite the adoption of inside sales, most selling teams tend to work best when they are working together. Sales is often about improvisation and collaboration with other functions and even large and distributed sales teams tend to do some activities in person - forecast meetings and reviews, sales training sessions, and cross-functional meetings. Remote working continues to grow across industries and several companies and their employees swear by their benefits. It is possible that even your Inside Sales team allows remote work, but as an exception and not a rule. However with the prevailing COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative that all sales leaders test the ability of their sales team to work remotely for extended periods - weeks, maybe months.
Here then are 3 tips to ready your sales team for remote working TIP 1 - Establish your Toolkit
A conversational intelligence tool like Salesken.ai would allow you to monitor the quality of all your reps’ conversations, glean helpful insights from the voice of your customers and let our AI, guide your reps on the frontline, with real-time cues and talking points. TIP 2 - Establish Processes
Once you have the right tools, it's important to set up processes that will enable your sales engine to keep cranking while your team works remotely.
Quick standups at the start and end of the working day will keep everyone clued in. It will also help you identify members of your team who may be struggling with the transition to remote sales. Try and use video conferencing where possible. This will ensure the connectedness and camaraderie of your team is preserved. TIP 3 - Continue to Improve
One of the limitations of remote working for sales leaders is the inability to improvise and adapt to changing marketing situations. Your “source of truth” is what your reps recall and record in the CRM and with everyone working away from each other - critical pieces of information will be lost.
Here then is how you can best replicate the high energy sales floor environment in a remote setup. (Disclaimer - this does include activities you can cover best with a conversational intelligence tool like Salesken.ai
In remote work, it will be harder for your reps to refer to their conversations for future actions or to discuss how they could have gone better. Using a conversation analytics tool like Salesken.ai will make this simpler - as you and your team would now have access to every call and its transcript with rich details. Your reps will not have to spend their time documenting every second of their conversations.
New competitors, market fluctuations, new feature requests, are all gathered over water cooler conversations or when you speak with your reps. With a tool like Salesken.ai, you will have the ability to record and analyze all calls and detect these trends early. It will also be convenient for your Solutions team and your Marketing team who will welcome these insights from the frontline As teams move to remote selling, it’s imperative to establish standardization. Most teams have a playbook or script they operate on. It’s important to enforce that your reps stick to playbooks and scripts in a remote setup. With Salesken.ai you will not only be able to ensure your reps are sticking to your playbook, but they will also get cues on how to handle every objection or how to best explain product features.
